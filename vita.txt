04/11/2024, 18:46 - Tim Farrelly: Unexplained:') But ah sure!
04/11/2024, 18:46 - Vita: as much as I’d really love to see you tonight it miiight be slightly short notice:,(
04/11/2024, 18:46 - Vita: if tomorrow doesnt work then I could possibly rally but yeah I have a ton to do :(
04/11/2024, 18:46 - Tim Farrelly: Ah no worries, I just threw that at you !
04/11/2024, 18:47 - Tim Farrelly: Could be a study date too tho ofc if that's not clear btw!
04/11/2024, 18:47 - Vita: unfortunately not! but we did some very interesting variations on down dog as well as some sexxxxy twists (sexy as in i got the nicest back cracks ever from them hahaha)
04/11/2024, 18:47 - Tim Farrelly: (sorry let me take that back as it was the plan - I'll see you tmrw anyways! Looking forward to it:) )
04/11/2024, 18:48 - Vita: very much likewise:))
04/11/2024, 18:48 - Tim Farrelly: You need to crack my back sometime!
04/11/2024, 18:48 - Vita: yeah see I planned on donating blood tomorrow after placement so was gonna combine that with seeing you etc!
04/11/2024, 18:48 - Vita: so if its cool it’d suit me to stick to the original plan
04/11/2024, 18:49 - Vita: I will for sure;) and give your lats a quick massage should they need it hehe
04/11/2024, 18:49 - Vita: also! something else im very looking forward to talking to you about tomorrow is that I had a peruse of some of the kama sutra positions last night and some of them are mad hahaha
04/11/2024, 18:49 - Vita: but some also look quite tempting to try so want your opinions;)
04/11/2024, 18:50 - Tim Farrelly: Sounds good! What time suits you?
04/11/2024, 18:51 - Tim Farrelly: Is just after 9 ok? I think I'll go to water polo after the run club, as I'll be going home on Wednesday evening
04/11/2024, 18:52 - Tim Farrelly: Hahahah I'm always down
04/11/2024, 18:52 - Vita: actually I’ll be donating in the cool building on d’olier street! pity you wont be around to check it out with me haha - but next time:)
04/11/2024, 18:52 - Tim Farrelly: Where did you find them? Cosmopolitan or other sources?
04/11/2024, 18:52 - Tim Farrelly: What time!?
04/11/2024, 18:52 - Vita: I cannot reveal my sources at this current time👀
04/11/2024, 18:53 - Vita: it’ll be around 5:40 - which now that you say we’d be meeting at 9 i probs wont combine that with meeting you hahaha so perhaps a silly reason to defer from tonight
04/11/2024, 18:54 - Vita: hmm many thoughts
04/11/2024, 18:54 - Vita: either way I’ll be free after 8 so 9 is perfect:)
04/11/2024, 18:54 - Vita: agh see now you’re tempting me to be spontaneous and come out to see you tonight hahaha
04/11/2024, 18:55 - Tim Farrelly: _smiling_
04/11/2024, 18:55 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>

04/11/2024, 18:55 - Vita: hehehe too late;)
04/11/2024, 18:55 - Tim Farrelly: I could pop by before my run club! I'd love to see inside!
04/11/2024, 18:55 - Vita: no take backsies😤
04/11/2024, 18:56 - Tim Farrelly: But really, whatever suits you best:) I'll fit everything in one way or another!
04/11/2024, 18:56 - Vita: hehehe
04/11/2024, 18:56 - Tim Farrelly: I could delete but consider it a gift😌
04/11/2024, 18:57 - Vita: okay not to be so annoying can I get back to you in 30 mins? so I can organize my thoughts(thots) and affairs😉
04/11/2024, 18:57 - Tim Farrelly: Hahaha yeah sounds good!
04/11/2024, 18:57 - Vita: dw my whatsapp is on autosave anyway🥵
04/11/2024, 18:57 - Vita: no escaping 😌
04/11/2024, 18:58 - Vita: fair warning if i do see you this evening I will be significantly less yassified than usual (but i promise no juicy tracksuit bottoms)
04/11/2024, 18:59 - Tim Farrelly: To let you know my plan, I'm just going to be working this evening, probably gonna head to the library now in a min. So am free whenever (for a study date).

Tmrw I have the run club at 6.20 (I'll need to leave around 6.10 so I'm not running to it, but tbh, I kinda need more than 5k so might run there anyways). Followed by water polo at 8, so will be free just after 9:)
04/11/2024, 19:01 - Tim Farrelly: Vita, I love how great you dress, but I'm honestly as happy to see you in leggings and no makeup very honestly!! (perhaps not the juicy couture tho😅)
04/11/2024, 19:01 - Tim Farrelly: You're hot, hot from far away, and hot with no makeup✅✅✅
04/11/2024, 19:01 - Tim Farrelly: ;)
04/11/2024, 19:02 - Vita: hehehe now I’m the one smiling;)
04/11/2024, 19:02 - Tim Farrelly: Emphasis on the _hot_ part
04/11/2024, 19:02 - Vita: okay perfect! let me get back to you on this!
04/11/2024, 19:03 - Tim Farrelly: Sounds good!
04/11/2024, 19:03 - Vita: I promise I’ll convert you to the juicies one way or another ;)
04/11/2024, 19:03 - Vita: (you’re very very sweet - and very much ditto)
04/11/2024, 19:26 - Vita: okay so …..
04/11/2024, 19:26 - Vita: is it cool if I join you in the lib?;)
04/11/2024, 19:27 - Vita: tonight that is
04/11/2024, 19:27 - Vita: because I thought about it a bit and I might be tired after donating blood tmw in which case might make more sense for me to work from home with a cup of tea:)
04/11/2024, 19:27 - Vita: will just get my affairs in order and head in the trinity direction hehe
04/11/2024, 19:34 - Tim Farrelly: Sounds good!!
04/11/2024, 19:34 - Tim Farrelly: That'll suit me best tbh:)
04/11/2024, 19:34 - Tim Farrelly: And could use some human motivation to get up out of bed and to the library as I'm absolutely wrecked lol

22/12/2024, 02:43 - Vita: we went to cis maddens in the end! and attempted nolita but it was full - nobody had the heart to trek to leggs in this weather loll
22/12/2024, 02:53 - Tim Farrelly: ah love to see it!
22/12/2024, 02:53 - Tim Farrelly: I just spent 5 hours on the Patch document - I should have got it done much faster but ah well
22/12/2024, 02:54 - Tim Farrelly: Onto more work now - just working out time/ commitments for Patch/ FOV, and then actually do some FOV work
22/12/2024, 02:54 - Tim Farrelly: ciss is always good vibes! were you outside?
22/12/2024, 03:07 - Vita: we actually managed to get a table inside which was mega good luck considering it was packed!

22/12/2024, 03:09 - Vita: night night tim :) xxx
22/12/2024, 05:59 - Tim Farrelly: Didn't make it that far, just found out I have a final assignment for a class due tmrw at 6pm lol (thankfully someone posted submitting it on their story hahah)
22/12/2024, 06:00 - Tim Farrelly: I would have stayed up working anyways, but was on that, need to finish it tmrw when I get up (need to make a 20 min video on a paper, all my slides are done now anyways )
22/12/2024, 06:01 - Tim Farrelly: I need better time tracking tools I think, to see how I'm spending time on my laptop - haven't found anything great yet!
22/12/2024, 06:01 - Tim Farrelly: It is! Will get feedback, but have a solid plan for if I do actually implement the initiative
22/12/2024, 06:04 - Tim Farrelly: Will text you tmrw, but could what are your thoughts on sleeping over late tmrw night (I won't get too drunk! You could join towards the end?)? Waking up and doing the Smithfield market/ Hugh Lane in the afternoon/ movie in the evening time? I might want to stay up late working the night of the 23rd (but I'm  unlikely to work when I get back tmrw night lol). Will text tmrw but let me know what you think of that!
22/12/2024, 06:06 - Tim Farrelly: All things considered, I really am quite productive from 9pm to 6am lmao
22/12/2024, 06:06 - Tim Farrelly: Anyways, hope you got some water before bed and get a good rest! Night x
22/12/2024, 12:36 - Vita: morning:) I woke up a lil while ago but have been dozing in bed hehe
22/12/2024, 12:36 - Vita: thank god you found out about that assignment tho hahaha good lord - is it worth much or just something small?
22/12/2024, 12:37 - Vita: oooh could be a side project if nothing exists…?👀
22/12/2024, 12:38 - Vita: we love to see it!:) v glad to hear
22/12/2024, 12:42 - Vita: and yeah this could potentially work! sure let me know how you’re feeling about it today anyway:) I’m not sure if I’d be up to joining pints later on because I’m grieviously hungover today somehow hahaha but can defo seee how I’m feeling later\just meet you after!
22/12/2024, 12:43 - Vita: hope you’re getting a good rest in:)
22/12/2024, 12:44 - Vita: a man built for the night shift…. you chose the wrong career😩
22/12/2024, 13:59 - Tim Farrelly: Good morning;)
22/12/2024, 13:59 - Tim Farrelly: How's the head haha?
22/12/2024, 13:59 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah no for real! I didn't bother checking - I don't think there was good documentation about how much it's worth, but at least 30% I'd say
22/12/2024, 14:00 - Tim Farrelly: Keep in mind a pass in 5th year is 50%, so yeah, thank God I found out lmao
22/12/2024, 14:01 - Tim Farrelly: I think so! There's already an open source version, but it ain't so good imo. It's tricky to do well, but I think I should be able to improve on things considerably
22/12/2024, 14:07 - Tim Farrelly: I think this would probably still suit well if it works for you! I'll text in a bit once I'm up properly to confirm if that's ok:) And no worries at all hahaha, hope you got some water and such before bed
22/12/2024, 14:26 - Vita: it’s not *too* bad hahaha - mostly just dehydrated and super tired:,)
22/12/2024, 14:26 - Vita: I’ve so much pre-christmas stuff to do today tho and have started on approximately zero loll
22/12/2024, 14:27 - Vita: but ah sure
22/12/2024, 14:27 - Vita: also wanna try get to the gym after i have a bit of food now but that will heavilyyy depend on if i feel nauseous or not after eating haha
22/12/2024, 14:28 - Vita: lmaoo thank god! wouldve been a christmas calamity if not 💀
22/12/2024, 14:28 - Vita: ngl tim as someone who gets anxious about college that’d be my worst nightmare hahaha
22/12/2024, 14:28 - Vita: but you got it sorted in no time anyway which we love to see:,)
22/12/2024, 14:29 - Vita: the mishap was no match for your efficiency!
22/12/2024, 14:29 - Vita: genuinely if you made a version of this I would 1000% use it hahah
22/12/2024, 14:30 - Vita: yeah sounds good - hopefully should be rested and un-hungover by the time I see you :,)

22/12/2024, 15:04 - Tim Farrelly: Ah sure indeed hahah, I'm sure it was a v good night! Is that mostly cooking and stuff, or what are you up to?
22/12/2024, 15:04 - Tim Farrelly: Hopefully you manage!
22/12/2024, 15:05 - Tim Farrelly: Still not finished it hahaha, I'm having brekkie rn (had a very slow and relaxed morning - shouldn't have, but ah well lol), and still need to write a script (via ChatGPT) and record a 20 minute video, but I shall manage
22/12/2024, 15:06 - Tim Farrelly: And need to do that in the 35 mins or will be late for 12 pubs hahah
22/12/2024, 15:06 - Tim Farrelly: Yes please!!!
22/12/2024, 15:06 - Tim Farrelly: A lil extra cardamom for me hehe;)
22/12/2024, 15:07 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah so if it works for you, I think it'd suit best if you came over later tonight with me, sleep over, and we have a nice date/ day during the day tmrw if that sounds good to you:)
22/12/2024, 15:08 - Tim Farrelly: Would you fancy coming to the gym with me here tmrw hahah? Should be able to sneak you in with sadhbhs student card! I unfortunately didn't wake up with time today (probably could have got in a quick one if I'd got straight out of bed and to work, but ah well)
22/12/2024, 15:38 - Vita: I made it to the gym! hehe
22/12/2024, 15:38 - Vita: so will reply properly in a bit :)

22/12/2024, 19:41 - Vita: <Media omitted>
22/12/2024, 19:41 - Vita: the loose cloves look a bit rank hahaha but the fruit was chilled so wasnt easy to stud them with the cloves

22/12/2024, 20:56 - Vita: because I had a specific one in mind and was unable to procure it  - the change of plans from meeting tomorrow evening to this evening somewhat intervened on this hahaha
22/12/2024, 20:56 - Vita: so yeah, my apologies
22/12/2024, 20:57 - Vita: if I have time I might make something but just a heads up that you might be receiving it post humously hahaha

22/12/2024, 21:28 - Vita: but worst case scenario i’ll meet you at yours!

24/12/2024, 21:13 - Vita: they only left just there to pick him up from the airport so, hopefully yes hahaha
24/12/2024, 21:14 - Vita: it was a nice day but quite unexpected that all of that happened - completely a cockup on behalf of KLM
24/12/2024, 21:14 - Vita: sad I didnt get to go for my run sadface:(
24/12/2024, 21:14 - Vita: but hopefully tmw!
24/12/2024, 21:14 - Vita: itching to get back to the gym to wear my new shorts hehe
24/12/2024, 21:25 - Tim Farrelly: Ok so you should have access to the Notion page - just check either of those emails. You can see it be published here: 

https://ethereal-society-312.notion.site/Travelling-with-Vita-January-24-1660833ba0fa80cfb6dbc0a1c59bacf4?pvs=4
24/12/2024, 21:25 - Tim Farrelly: but you won't be able to edit from that link - will have to check your email
24/12/2024, 21:25 - Tim Farrelly: Does your psych placement have any sort of flexibility do you know?
24/12/2024, 21:25 - Tim Farrelly: ah glad to hear!
24/12/2024, 21:26 - Tim Farrelly: aww no - tmrw! I brought my running gear with me here too hehe
24/12/2024, 22:01 - Vita: I mean I might be able to leave early one of the fridays but i’d need to be back in on the monday - that’d be the extent of it though
24/12/2024, 22:01 - Vita: it’s from the 6th of jan to the 17th anyway!
24/12/2024, 22:01 - Vita: aww v nice, twinning with a run on christmas day hehe
24/12/2024, 22:02 - Vita: wonderful! shall add some to it later x
24/12/2024, 22:02 - Vita: we’re just about to watch a movie here:,)
24/12/2024, 22:02 - Vita: i suggested hot frosty but my brother wouldnt have it😩
24/12/2024, 22:03 - Vita: though this would depend… like I could probs miss the monday if i was in on the prior friday if that makes sense!
24/12/2024, 22:03 - Vita: just saw the venice thing in the notion and that’d probs be doable with the placement for example:)
24/12/2024, 22:04 - Vita: so could probs miss one day provided i was in all the others if that makes sense!
24/12/2024, 22:04 - Vita: thanks for making that btw it looks great! xx
24/12/2024, 22:47 - Tim Farrelly: Text later! Pints now
25/12/2024, 00:11 - Tim Farrelly: ok sweet! So college starts on the 20th for me, but that really doesn't count for much hahah
25/12/2024, 00:12 - Tim Farrelly: So I'm super flexible, main thing is just that I'll be getting increasingly busy from mid jan onwards with work (patch, fov, hack ireland) so sooner the better! So the 17th-19th or so is good!
25/12/2024, 00:13 - Tim Farrelly: noted! I'm more flexible here anyways1
25/12/2024, 00:13 - Tim Farrelly: !*
25/12/2024, 00:13 - Tim Farrelly: pints were nice - saw a good few old faces!
25/12/2024, 00:14 - Tim Farrelly: also - not Istanbul for this trip hahaha - flights are just shy of 8 hours even if they're direct haha!
25/12/2024, 00:17 - Vita: that’s perfect, let’s try stick with those dates so; unless venice is particularly tempting - which is sooner anyway so would imagine that’d suit:)
25/12/2024, 00:18 - Vita: okay so we have dates, all we need is a location now;)
25/12/2024, 00:18 - Vita: just finished up with family time so gonna climb into bed and do some research!
25/12/2024, 00:18 - Vita: aww love to see it:,) hope it was the christmas eve you hoped for hehe
25/12/2024, 00:19 - Vita: oh lord okay well that’s one down at least!! haha
25/12/2024, 00:19 - Vita: also i gotta say this looks fucking banging + i love the hand coming in for a bite haha
25/12/2024, 00:19 - Vita: i might cum
25/12/2024, 00:20 - Vita: good grief those are some sexy lamps
25/12/2024, 01:05 - Tim Farrelly: hahahaha unreal lamps aren't they!
25/12/2024, 01:05 - Tim Farrelly: which movie did you end up watching?
25/12/2024, 01:05 - Tim Farrelly: Would you fancy a very quick call re: cities in a bit?
25/12/2024, 01:07 - Vita: we ended up watching nativity hahaha - not our usual vibe but did the trick
25/12/2024, 01:08 - Vita: tbh I might have to head to bed here very soon unfortunately but would love to at some point tmw if we get a sec or the day after?!
25/12/2024, 01:08 - Vita: getting v excited for this now:,)
25/12/2024, 01:13 - Tim Farrelly: ah ofc! Chat at some stage tmrw!

25/12/2024, 01:16 - Vita: I’m currently having a browse on google maps about morrocco and all of the locations- starring etc as I go anything that looks cool, so shall debrief tmw ;)
25/12/2024, 01:16 - Tim Farrelly: there'll be a pdf in your email inbox tmrw morning;) Unfortunately no promises on the PDF being anything fancy, but there'll be something there you'll enjoy
25/12/2024, 01:16 - Vita: but am doing this for each of the cities we’re interested in!
25/12/2024, 01:17 - Tim Farrelly: perfecto!
25/12/2024, 01:17 - Tim Farrelly: thanks!
25/12/2024, 01:17 - Vita: so we can decide what we’re most excited about:)
25/12/2024, 01:17 - Vita: no problem at all!
25/12/2024, 01:17 - Vita: its lowkey giving me food envy tho hahaha
25/12/2024, 01:17 - Vita: made the mistake of seeing how much a fancy ass meal in marrakesh would cost (about the same as a nice meal out here haha)
25/12/2024, 01:17 - Vita: but more research needed! watch this space lol
25/12/2024, 01:18 - Vita: oooh I look forward to it:)
25/12/2024, 01:18 - Vita: ooh v v nice:,) hope the orchard thieves didnt go to your head hehe
25/12/2024, 01:34 - Vita: off to sleep now but chat tmw, looking forward to planning this!! merry christmas xx
25/12/2024, 01:59 - Tim Farrelly: We might also want to look at Valencia!!

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Arts_and_Sciences
25/12/2024, 01:59 - Tim Farrelly: not to be slept on - and reasonably price wise!
25/12/2024, 02:23 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
25/12/2024, 02:29 - Tim Farrelly: re: travelling - im happy with any of them! I've crossed out venice (too pricey in comparison) and added in Valencia. I might just have a little more look at what exactly there is to do in each
25/12/2024, 03:03 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
25/12/2024, 03:04 - Tim Farrelly: Got these for myself in HF earlier, great value! Rothko was 8, and the Picasso book is part 4 in a massive biography on him (ive part 1, which I'm yet to read, this one is in colour tho! Now just find part 2 and 3)
25/12/2024, 09:27 - Vita: good morning:)
25/12/2024, 09:27 - Vita: oooh wonderful! they both look brilliant!!
25/12/2024, 09:28 - Vita: though why is picasso doing a blue eyed stare in that pic (despite having famously brown eyes lmao)
25/12/2024, 09:28 - Vita: very balenciaga😩
25/12/2024, 09:28 - Vita: I had a quick look at food here and there is a ton of great cheap eats!! we should defo consider!
25/12/2024, 09:29 - Vita: i see you threw in seville as well - my parents used to live there so would have some great recs, will ask them if a jan trip would be good!
25/12/2024, 09:29 - Vita: would probs be nice and cheap + temperate enough as well!

25/12/2024, 13:23 - Tim Farrelly: Ooo nice! I don't think that made it to the "summary" stage, I'm guessing flights weren't great

25/12/2024, 15:24 - Vita: <Media omitted>

25/12/2024, 17:30 - Vita: hahahaha oh my god!!!
25/12/2024, 17:30 - Vita: lmaoooo
25/12/2024, 17:30 - Vita: the way in which I thought you rick rolled me four times and that was it at first💀
25/12/2024, 17:31 - Vita: but the emojis absolutely killed me that’s too good
25/12/2024, 17:32 - Vita: thank you so much that’s by far my favourite gift hahaha
25/12/2024, 17:33 - Vita: but seriously, very very funny and thoughtful, looking forward to adding more to it together:,) x
25/12/2024, 18:08 - Tim Farrelly: I'm about to catch up on texts then will probs do some research + coding later!
25/12/2024, 18:08 - Tim Farrelly: I'll give you a buzz when I've looked at the places a lil more - I'm leaning towards Marakesh and Valencia at this stage!
25/12/2024, 18:09 - Tim Farrelly: that looks like quite a hamper!
25/12/2024, 18:09 - Tim Farrelly: I can't get over how arts-blocky your mom looks haha!
25/12/2024, 18:09 - Tim Farrelly: its just the hair - very cool!
25/12/2024, 18:12 - Tim Farrelly: yep! Rituals, socks, moisturizer and some other small bits - paid for concert tickets for a thing I'll be seeing with Omar in May and money towards our flights, and my mom also got me some thoughtful-ish gifts but asked her to try and return them if she can hahaha. Got me a "Friends" membership at both the National Gallery and the National Concert Hall, but you really get absolutely no value for money with them (at least the NCH one), so hoping they can be refunded, or at least get a credit note in place
25/12/2024, 18:13 - Tim Farrelly: ah no - period pains?
25/12/2024, 18:13 - Tim Farrelly: v sexy
25/12/2024, 18:13 - Tim Farrelly: on my laptop but will send a pic of ours from my phone when im on - was stupidly good
25/12/2024, 18:13 - Tim Farrelly: ah glad you enjoyed hahaha - look forward to adding more to it too;)
25/12/2024, 18:14 - Vita: oh hello:)
25/12/2024, 18:14 - Vita: just sitting down on the couch with a cup of tea and the brothers karamazov hehe
25/12/2024, 18:15 - Vita: likewise! I actually did a bit of food research for each ;) and both look unreal for that
25/12/2024, 18:15 - Vita: sounds good anyway, can discuss later:)
25/12/2024, 18:16 - Vita: hahahaha she really is, wait til you meet her lmao
25/12/2024, 18:16 - Vita: she often borrows my long black fur coat as well
25/12/2024, 18:16 - Vita: defo adds to the vibe lmao
25/12/2024, 18:16 - Vita: yeah I was really happy with their reactions:)
25/12/2024, 18:17 - Vita: oh brilliant! where’s the concert you’re seeing with omar on again?! pity about the NCH friends thing though, didnt realise they were such bad value - what’s the reason for it?
25/12/2024, 18:18 - Vita: yeah :( plus slept really really poorly last night - but had a borocca and a nap so feel a lot better now!
25/12/2024, 18:19 - Vita: also was just quite socially burnt out from entertaining yesterday for some reason, so never quite got into the christmas spirit as i usually do
25/12/2024, 18:19 - Vita: please do!
25/12/2024, 18:19 - Vita: hehehe next up valencia or marrakesh ;)
25/12/2024, 18:21 - Vita: <Media omitted>
25/12/2024, 18:23 - Tim Farrelly: perfecto
25/12/2024, 18:23 - Tim Farrelly: hahahah love to hear it
25/12/2024, 18:23 - Tim Farrelly: does she wear docs...!?
25/12/2024, 18:24 - Tim Farrelly: its Tchaikovsky and wagner in royal albert hall, hosted by the Rest is History podcast! They'll be talking about the composers
25/12/2024, 18:24 - Tim Farrelly: its on in London in may
25/12/2024, 18:26 - Tim Farrelly: NCH friends - the primary value of it seems to be in socials organised for other friends. But I don't really care for that haha. They give a non-specified discount on concert tickets too, but again, its non specified, they say up to 30%, but again, its non-specified which isn't a good sign (I'd estimate its closer to 10% on average, so would have to go to at least 1 concert a month with 3 people at €30 a ticket to get money back on Friends for a year). But a credit note would be good and be used (as long as it doesnt run out too fast)!
25/12/2024, 18:27 - Tim Farrelly: Very cute - esp the anime skirt ;)
25/12/2024, 19:49 - Vita: the vibes are unmatched, gonna start taking my kindle out places with me again to avoid scrolling on reels while the algorithm is being mean to me hehe 👌
25/12/2024, 19:50 - Vita: also ngl the brothers karamazov has got saucy again, I’ll probs be finished it in the next few days
25/12/2024, 19:50 - Vita: unfortunately not! but I’m trying to get her into wearing them hehe
25/12/2024, 19:50 - Vita: also started breaking mine in - wore em to mass today… have a feeling those blister patches’ll be coming in clutchh
25/12/2024, 19:50 - Vita: (thank you again for those! x)
25/12/2024, 19:51 - Vita: that’s gonna be so so unbelievable:,)
25/12/2024, 19:52 - Vita: awww cmon tim dont you wanna hang out with the other friends???!😩😩
25/12/2024, 19:53 - Vita: but no that’s so fair, it sounds like terribly bad value especially for a student! I can see it maybe for someone wanting to support the arts who’s super into that but yeah for your purposes it’s a pity it’s set up that way
25/12/2024, 19:54 - Vita: is the national gallery one a bit better for you at least?
25/12/2024, 20:42 - Tim Farrelly: you should!
25/12/2024, 20:42 - Tim Farrelly: hahaha not yet so
25/12/2024, 20:43 - Tim Farrelly: dont wait to use them! And you can leave them on for at least a couple days - even with a shower in between
25/12/2024, 20:43 - Tim Farrelly: hahahaha yeah
25/12/2024, 20:44 - Tim Farrelly: its better, and wayyy cheaper thankfully! But hopefully can still return and just use the money for something else! Was still thoughtful of her - she just really likes to have something under the tree for us
25/12/2024, 20:57 - Tim Farrelly: would you like to do a quick call sometime soon to go through flights/ travel?
25/12/2024, 21:13 - Vita: yes would love to! I’m just about to watch a movie with the family but will be around after if that suits?!
25/12/2024, 21:24 - Tim Farrelly: Sweet - approx what time? 11.30?
25/12/2024, 21:25 - Vita: yes around then would be perfect!
25/12/2024, 21:40 - Tim Farrelly: Perf!
25/12/2024, 23:29 - Vita: will probs be closer to 11:45 if thats okay, just finishing the movie now!!
25/12/2024, 23:30 - Tim Farrelly: Suits well!
25/12/2024, 23:30 - Tim Farrelly: didn't realise the time - moved onto fov thinking
25/12/2024, 23:43 - Tim Farrelly: sry does closer to 23:50 suit?
25/12/2024, 23:49 - Tim Farrelly: does 12:00 actually sound ok! Speaking with my mom!
25/12/2024, 23:49 - Tim Farrelly: sorry it seems I use extra exclamation marks when Im on my laptop hahaha
25/12/2024, 23:50 - Vita: no worries!! hahaha
25/12/2024, 23:50 - Vita: this movie is way longer than i thought anyway
25/12/2024, 23:50 - Vita: so 12 is perf
25/12/2024, 23:50 - Tim Farrelly: sweet
25/12/2024, 23:50 - Tim Farrelly: talk then
25/12/2024, 23:58 - Tim Farrelly: sorry maybe 00:15 - that should be a comfortable buffer for talking to fam (still chatting to my mom)
25/12/2024, 23:59 - Vita: thats okay, gives me a chance to grab my laptop etc. we’ve only all split up for the evening now

26/12/2024, 01:42 - Vita: be honest…. if you had the money and the property, would you be attempting…?

26/12/2024, 02:48 - Tim Farrelly: there's one particularly absolutely incredibly looking gallery in Valencia - that I imagine is quite new! Its a billionaire business woman's
26/12/2024, 02:48 - Tim Farrelly: https://www.cahh.es/en/
26/12/2024, 02:59 - Tim Farrelly: btw, when does it suit you to meetup:) ?

26/12/2024, 15:34 - Tim Farrelly: good morning lmao
26/12/2024, 15:34 - Tim Farrelly: my phone ran out of charge hahaha
26/12/2024, 15:34 - Tim Farrelly: my family all left for lunch I believe not wanting to wake me up - I had to open up my laptop to see what time it is as my phone takes so long to come back to life
26/12/2024, 15:35 - Tim Farrelly: tmrw evening is good!
26/12/2024, 15:35 - Tim Farrelly: what are you up to today?
26/12/2024, 16:00 - Vita: reply in a bit - some family just arrived, uninvited 😐
26/12/2024, 16:38 - Tim Farrelly: god forbid 😮🙈☠    ;)
26/12/2024, 16:39 - Tim Farrelly: hahahaha
26/12/2024, 16:39 - Tim Farrelly: I'm just properly up now lol, seems to take a while for me to get dressed, etc.
26/12/2024, 16:39 - Vita: sorry hahahaha omg I probably seem like such a grinch but my entire family collectively groaned when we realised they were coming ahhaha
26/12/2024, 16:39 - Vita: we might be a liiiiittle bit antisocial as a family
26/12/2024, 16:39 - Tim Farrelly: ah fair fair hahahah
26/12/2024, 16:39 - Vita: just a little
26/12/2024, 16:39 - Vita: hahahaha
26/12/2024, 16:40 - Vita: (this was meant in a more jovial tone but had to run since I was being called hahaha)
26/12/2024, 16:40 - Vita: hehehe
26/12/2024, 16:40 - Vita: oh good grief hahaha
26/12/2024, 16:40 - Tim Farrelly: I'm just at home here alone atm, my family were going for lunch with extended family, but they saw me sleeping so assumed I needed it hahaha (left the apartment at 1:45!)
26/12/2024, 16:41 - Vita: oh very very fair
26/12/2024, 16:41 - Tim Farrelly: They were getting the sexy chicken wings up in Howth - so particularly unfortunate of my phone to run out of battery overnight
26/12/2024, 16:41 - Vita: is the sleep schedule improving?!👀
26/12/2024, 16:41 - Vita: oh no!!!
26/12/2024, 16:41 - Vita: that’s such a pity omg
26/12/2024, 16:41 - Tim Farrelly: my phone was literally at 90% or so btw lol. I remember distinctly not caring about whether or not to bring in my charger to bed from the kitchen, since its a hassle to plug it in, but I still did so!
26/12/2024, 16:42 - Tim Farrelly: need to get the battery replaced on it - might see if I can book it in online
26/12/2024, 16:42 - Tim Farrelly: ehhhh
26/12/2024, 16:42 - Vita: oh lord - yeah I think a battery replacement is well, well needed; christmas gift from you to yourself perhaps?! ;)
26/12/2024, 16:43 - Tim Farrelly: not quite - but its self induced hahah - gonna get some work done now earlier anyways, and try to get to sleep earlier tonight (we'll see since I literally slept in till 3:30 hahaha)
26/12/2024, 16:43 - Vita: rip on this front, perhaps you can get some of the lads out for them soon?!
26/12/2024, 16:43 - Tim Farrelly: if it doesn't happen tonight, will need to rely on you to tire me out tmrw;)
26/12/2024, 16:43 - Vita: if you ever need, I actually have some melatonin knocking around hehe
26/12/2024, 16:43 - Vita: although were you saying it doesnt work for you..?
26/12/2024, 16:43 - Tim Farrelly: ah ill get the fam up there soon again I think hahha!
26/12/2024, 16:44 - Tim Farrelly: no that wasn't me!
26/12/2024, 16:44 - Tim Farrelly: I should be ok though - thank you!
26/12/2024, 16:44 - Vita: oh wonderful! well if you ever need it… hmu ;)

26/12/2024, 16:45 - Vita: so the family only popped by for a few minutes thank god, on the couch with fred and gonna take some time to read my book before going for a run:)
26/12/2024, 16:45 - Vita: re: tomorrow I have an extended family lunch in the middle of the day but will be around after :)
26/12/2024, 16:45 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah *thank god*
26/12/2024, 16:45 - Tim Farrelly: hahahahahahaha
26/12/2024, 16:46 - Vita: tim I’m always happy to help reset it ;)
26/12/2024, 16:46 - Vita: HAHAHAHA
26/12/2024, 16:46 - Vita: sorry omg
26/12/2024, 16:46 - Vita: 💀
26/12/2024, 16:46 - Vita: that genuinely was a slip of the fingers if you will💀💀💀
26/12/2024, 16:46 - Vita: did not mean to type that💀
26/12/2024, 16:46 - Tim Farrelly: hahahahaha oh god im laughing too much to type
26/12/2024, 16:47 - Tim Farrelly: sweet!
26/12/2024, 16:47 - Vita: no tim like I genuinely do like my extended family but my immediate family are so so antisocial HAHAHAHA
26/12/2024, 16:47 - Tim Farrelly: I'll be heading back to campus later this evening - I think I'm going to meet up with omar and David to have an fov meeting, will text you later to confirm, but should def be free in the evening time
26/12/2024, 16:47 - Vita: like we need to mentally prepare to see anyone outside of the immediate fam
26/12/2024, 16:48 - Vita: 😩😩😩😩 this isnt funnnyyyyy😩😩
26/12/2024, 16:48 - Vita: (okay it kinda is lmao)
26/12/2024, 16:48 - Tim Farrelly: ah fair enough hahaha
26/12/2024, 16:48 - Vita: ((i may have been laughing myself)
26/12/2024, 16:48 - Vita: absolutely outing myself here lmfao
26/12/2024, 16:48 - Vita: <Media omitted>
26/12/2024, 16:48 - Vita: me rn
26/12/2024, 16:49 - Vita: im gonna stop talking about visitors i think it may be wisest…….
26/12/2024, 16:49 - Vita: okay perfect! all sounds like a plan:)
26/12/2024, 16:49 - Vita: and shall we book flights for valencia tonight…?
26/12/2024, 16:55 - Tim Farrelly: hahahahaha
26/12/2024, 16:56 - Tim Farrelly: yes!
26/12/2024, 16:56 - Tim Farrelly: I'll get round to looking (one sec)
26/12/2024, 17:00 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah I'll look more at iternary later/ what we could realistically fit into x days
26/12/2024, 17:08 - Vita: wonderful:) I shall do the same after some reading and running!
26/12/2024, 17:09 - Vita: what’s your plan today anyway?! mostly work stuff or some more fam time before you head off?
26/12/2024, 18:32 - Tim Farrelly: You deleted this message
26/12/2024, 18:33 - Tim Farrelly: gonna head into town later today - just working otherwise/ watching my sister quite closely, I think she has pneumonia and I'd probably be in favour of bringing her into hospital today rather than waiting for GP tmrw
26/12/2024, 18:39 - Tim Farrelly: she's had recurring lung infections - the GPs don't say more than that, and unfortunately my family don't ask for more info - and I think it could be quite serious potentially
26/12/2024, 19:42 - Vita: oh jesus
26/12/2024, 19:42 - Vita: wish you were closer so could drop my steth so you could have a listen to her chest / percuss her to see if there’s pneumonia there
26/12/2024, 19:43 - Vita: oh fuck poor sadbh :( that sounds like a horrible time
26/12/2024, 19:44 - Vita: are they doing investigations to see what the cause of the recurrence might be at least do you know?!
26/12/2024, 19:44 - Vita: and is she on antibiotics atm?
26/12/2024, 19:45 - Vita: but yeah defo keep an eye on her, let me know how she’s doing. make sure she’s hydrating as well if she can tolerate oral intake that’s absolutely key
26/12/2024, 21:00 - Tim Farrelly: Not really - will explain later
26/12/2024, 21:00 - Tim Farrelly: And I believe she finished her course from her last lung infection but has inhalers now (two different types, not sure exactly what)
26/12/2024, 21:02 - Tim Farrelly: I'm back in Trinity now actually, she improved quite a bit before I left. These were the notes I wrote up earlier for my parents to tell the doctors in case she gets bad again and needs to go into hospital:


Key Information to Tell Doctors:
1. Current Symptoms:
- Severe chest pain (especially with breathing)
- Difficulty breathing/coughing fits (she can't breath deeply without a coughing fit)
- Cold hands (alleviated now)
- Fever
- Trouble walking/weakness
- Headache/light sensitivity

2. Critical History:
- Previous lung lesions found on X-ray (mention these were never followed up with CT scan)
- Recurring lung infections (this is her 4th) 
- Pain gets worse with deep breaths
- Coughing fits so severe they nearly cause vomiting
26/12/2024, 21:04 - Tim Farrelly: And don't worry, had plenty of chats with ChatGPT and claude hahah
26/12/2024, 21:04 - Tim Farrelly: I'm going to make sure things get followed up with this time - especially wrt the CT scan
26/12/2024, 21:05 - Tim Farrelly: Sadhbh can be a bit stubborn, didn't want to do the CT scan, and didn't listen to my moms advice - shes changed her mind now
26/12/2024, 21:06 - Tim Farrelly: Anyways, I'm just back in Trinity, will we call at some stage to book things? I'm just working otherwise so free whenever:)
26/12/2024, 21:09 - Vita: was there any particular reason for this or did she just not feel like it? either way glad to hear she changed her mind!
26/12/2024, 21:09 - Vita: aww great:) I’m just about to watch a movie with my parents so will be free around 11/11:30 for this!!
26/12/2024, 21:09 - Tim Farrelly: Ah can explain when we call. But yeah, me too!
26/12/2024, 21:09 - Tim Farrelly: Grand, sounds good!
26/12/2024, 21:10 - Vita: okay yay! look forward to it, chat soon xx
26/12/2024, 23:02 - Vita: 11:30 suit?! just finishing up here!
26/12/2024, 23:02 - Tim Farrelly: Perfect!
27/12/2024, 00:01 - Vita: really hope everythings okay and that she’s not waiting too long to be seen:(
27/12/2024, 00:05 - Vita: if she’s stopped urinating as well or hasnt urinated in awhile also important to mention that
27/12/2024, 00:08 - Vita: also all of this stuff ofc but especially make sure they don’t forget to mention the light sensitivity and headache, that definitely needs flagging
27/12/2024, 00:08 - Tim Farrelly: Got it, thank you!!
27/12/2024, 00:09 - Vita: no worries!! thinking of you all, keep me updated x
27/12/2024, 00:12 - Tim Farrelly: Still not in the car :/
27/12/2024, 00:12 - Tim Farrelly: But going out now!!
27/12/2024, 00:12 - Tim Farrelly: Key Information to Tell Doctors:
1. Current Symptoms:
- Severe chest pain (especially with breathing)
- Difficulty breathing/coughing fits (she can't breath deeply without a coughing fit)
- Cold hands
- Fever
- Trouble walking/weakness
- *Headache/light sensitivity* 

2. Critical History:
- Previous lung lesions found on X-ray (mention these were never followed up with CT scan)
- Recurring lung infections (this is her 4th) 
- Pain gets worse with deep breaths
- Coughing fits so severe they nearly cause vomiting

Updates: 

Sepsis seems possible. This must be acted on immediately: 

- Altered state of consciousness (she's delerious) 
- developed very high temperature within recent time period (tell them however long, I assume <2 hours) 

Clarify whether or not she has stopped urinating
27/12/2024, 00:13 - Tim Farrelly: Thanks for highlighting that stuff:)
27/12/2024, 00:14 - Vita: great, this is very concise
27/12/2024, 00:14 - Vita: will help immensely
27/12/2024, 00:15 - Vita: okay wonderful!
27/12/2024, 00:16 - Vita: what hospital is closest to you guys?
27/12/2024, 00:16 - Tim Farrelly: Beaumont
27/12/2024, 00:16 - Tim Farrelly: I might try ringing them myself now
27/12/2024, 00:16 - Tim Farrelly: And sending that ahead of time, if I can get through
27/12/2024, 00:17 - Vita: really hope they can get out there soon, is sadbh having issues mobilising what with her fever etc?
27/12/2024, 00:17 - Vita: yes absolutely, that’d be key
27/12/2024, 00:17 - Tim Farrelly: <15 mins once they get in the car
27/12/2024, 00:17 - Tim Farrelly: Idk unfortunately
27/12/2024, 00:17 - Vita: okay brilliant
27/12/2024, 00:18 - Vita: do what you gotta do anyway, let me know if you need me for anything at all I’m here
27/12/2024, 00:38 - Tim Farrelly: she's still peeing anyways apparently
27/12/2024, 00:38 - Tim Farrelly: they should be just arriving in the hospital now
27/12/2024, 00:38 - Vita: good sign!
27/12/2024, 00:38 - Vita: unfortunately doesnt rule out sepsis but is a good sign all the same
27/12/2024, 00:39 - Tim Farrelly: I wasn't able to ring ahead. Rang the recption, and they put me through to A and E, who ironically left me on the waiting line for 5 mins haha
27/12/2024, 00:39 - Vita: hahaha oh lord
27/12/2024, 00:39 - Tim Farrelly: ahh yep - good sign anwyays1
27/12/2024, 00:39 - Tim Farrelly: !*
27/12/2024, 00:39 - Vita: okay amazing
27/12/2024, 00:39 - Vita: if pt pees, this we love to see
27/12/2024, 00:39 - Tim Farrelly: will keep you updated - just hoping my mom just gets to front desk as soon as possible and skips any queue to mention sepsis
27/12/2024, 00:40 - Tim Farrelly: hahaha agreed
27/12/2024, 00:41 - Vita: thank you, and absolutely - once it’s mentioned hopefully they’ll snap right into protocol
27/12/2024, 00:48 - Tim Farrelly: she's in the hospital now anwyays1
27/12/2024, 00:48 - Tim Farrelly: !*
27/12/2024, 00:48 - Tim Farrelly: protocol seems to be taking more than 5 mins to activate but hopefully soon - its quite busy in there apparently
27/12/2024, 01:39 - Tim Farrelly: Not sadhbh!!!!
27/12/2024, 01:39 - Tim Farrelly: Not sadhbh!
27/12/2024, 01:40 - Tim Farrelly: She's not in cardiac arrest
27/12/2024, 01:40 - Tim Farrelly: Someone near sadhbh is in it
27/12/2024, 01:40 - Tim Farrelly: Right beside her apparently
27/12/2024, 01:40 - Vita: This message was deleted
27/12/2024, 01:40 - Vita: that’s absolutely horrible, sorry I thought you meant her for a second jesus
27/12/2024, 02:10 - Vita: <Media omitted>
27/12/2024, 02:11 - Vita: omfg

27/12/2024, 02:30 - Tim Farrelly: Hehe

27/12/2024, 02:34 - Tim Farrelly: oh sry one last thing!
27/12/2024, 02:34 - Tim Farrelly: Do you think you'll fit everything in a big backpack?
27/12/2024, 02:35 - Vita: dw I am a very light packer - I’ll make it work ;)
27/12/2024, 02:35 - Tim Farrelly: Sweet!
27/12/2024, 02:35 - Tim Farrelly: Looking forward to it!!
27/12/2024, 02:36 - Vita: will only be bringing my skimpiest underwear to save space🫡🫡
27/12/2024, 02:36 - Vita: same!
27/12/2024, 02:36 - Vita: can’t wait:,)
27/12/2024, 02:37 - Tim Farrelly: sadhbh just has the flu!
27/12/2024, 02:37 - Tim Farrelly: no sepsis
27/12/2024, 02:49 - Tim Farrelly: booked the return flights just there:

QPEBQZ
27/12/2024, 02:49 - Tim Farrelly: Should be able to get it with that code on your app
27/12/2024, 02:49 - Tim Farrelly: gonna decide between Alicante and Valencia now for flying out!
27/12/2024, 02:56 - Vita: ah amazing!
27/12/2024, 02:57 - Vita: sorry I’m gonna actually sleep now, got caught up doing research on anal haha. but just putting a reminder here because there’s one thing I wanna talk out with you beforehand! nothing major just a couple of anxieties for my own comfort haha
27/12/2024, 02:57 - Vita: also - oh thank fuck part two
27/12/2024, 02:57 - Vita: hahaha
27/12/2024, 02:57 - Vita: that is such a relief
27/12/2024, 02:58 - Vita: well maybe not quite but thank god its not sepsis
27/12/2024, 02:59 - Tim Farrelly: Yes of course! Let's talk about it tmrw. And ofc will also say, if you're nervous/ not ready tmrw, totally cool too!
27/12/2024, 03:00 - Vita: oh eh I wasnt thinking we’d be doing it tomorrow, sorry if that was a miscommunication
27/12/2024, 03:00 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah no thank God! And she should get good care now - will be getting an X-ray and hopefully booked in for CT scan
27/12/2024, 03:00 - Tim Farrelly: Ah no worries
27/12/2024, 03:00 - Vita: I’m getting pretty stressed about the mess aspect, mostly because the people you’ve done it with before have been so apparently perfectly clean and I am absolutely terrified I wouldnt be
27/12/2024, 03:00 - Tim Farrelly: Hahahahahaha
27/12/2024, 03:00 - Vita: so I really wont feel comfortable until I’m absolutely sure I can do it mess free
27/12/2024, 03:01 - Tim Farrelly: Don't worry at all about that!
27/12/2024, 03:01 - Tim Farrelly: 1. I'll lay down a towel.
2. I know what I'm getting into (literally lol)
27/12/2024, 03:02 - Vita: hahahaha you just seemed so proud to have no horror stories and of their “genetically clean assholes” and I am quite afraid I will not measure up hahaha
27/12/2024, 03:02 - Tim Farrelly: And also I won't be comparing you to them fyi, not could I - they were both fwbs, you're obviously not
27/12/2024, 03:02 - Tim Farrelly: Hahahaha one of them I'm convinced was an anomaly. The other was also very clean, but not as "genetically clean" lol
27/12/2024, 03:03 - Tim Farrelly: I think the main thing is just doing it when you don't need to go bathroom lol
27/12/2024, 03:03 - Tim Farrelly: We can have a scroll through reddit tmrw and see what they say
27/12/2024, 03:03 - Tim Farrelly: Or even better, ChatGPT
27/12/2024, 03:03 - Tim Farrelly: Are you nervous about it for me, or for you?
27/12/2024, 03:04 - Vita: reddit’s been suggesting enemas so I probs wanna pick one of those up beforehand
27/12/2024, 03:04 - Tim Farrelly: Cool!
27/12/2024, 03:04 - Vita: if I’m being entirely honest I probably wouldnt be this stressed had you not had such flawless prior experiences hahaha
27/12/2024, 03:04 - Tim Farrelly: Fyi, if that's a hassle, both the girls I did it with never did anemas, they just had a shower I believe and made the outside was clean, and maybe pointed the jet up that way lol
27/12/2024, 03:04 - Vita: so for you tbh
27/12/2024, 03:05 - Vita: I just don’t want to gross you out hahaha
27/12/2024, 03:05 - Tim Farrelly: Don't be stressed!!!
27/12/2024, 03:05 - Vita: so put it down to performance anxiety, I guess?!
27/12/2024, 03:05 - Vita: sorry I know this isnt at all sexy!
27/12/2024, 03:05 - Tim Farrelly: You won't!!
27/12/2024, 03:26 - Vita: thanks so much again, feel a lot more comfortable after talking to you x
27/12/2024, 03:41 - Tim Farrelly: Ok so I'm going to sleep on it (going to turn off my laptop now, and do some reading:) ) but... here's what I think could actually be really cool for Spain!

I changed my mind on Alicante, it just doesn't look like that cool a place hahaha, although the contemporary museum there looks like it has some nice pieces (I watched a few vids, and def looks like more of a beach/ cheaper marbella type place - still lovely, but nothing too special).

Madrid is 3 times as far away, however it has the legit fast trains to Alicante and its actually even faster to get to Valencia from it (1 hour, 50 mins) and the trains are quite frequent (like at least one every hour vs Alicante had one every couple hours) and they're cheaper too (€15 generally) - ill attach a link. And Madrid is a sick little city I wouldn't mind visiting again!
27/12/2024, 03:41 - Tim Farrelly: Ryanair has a direct flight out at 7:55 -> 11:30 landing in madrid. Would you fancy spending the day in madrid. Visit a museum, the town squares, etc.) and then get a late evening train out to Valencia?
27/12/2024, 03:42 - Tim Farrelly: I know it complicates things slightly but I think even in case the Ryanair flight gets delayed, we'll still have time to have a really nice day in madrid if we get a late evening train. And there's plenty to see there!
27/12/2024, 03:43 - Tim Farrelly: Trains: 

https://www.thetrainline.com/book/results?origin=urn%3Atrainline%3Ageneric%3Aloc%3A6663&destination=urn%3Atrainline%3Ageneric%3Aloc%3A23634&outwardDate=2025-01-18T13%3A00%3A00&outwardDateType=departAfter&journeySearchType=single&passengers%5B%5D=1991-12-27%7Cpid-0&directSearch=false&transportModes%5B%5D=mixed&selectedOutward=yBnhS%2FTXDLU%3D%3A8I%2F1ESYmANM%3D%3AStandard&searchId=f94232cf-2714-47f7-bd3b-2063368f1725&temporalDirection=next&transitDefinitionDirection=outward
27/12/2024, 03:44 - Tim Farrelly: Or could also go to Valencia more directly earlier on! But I think some time in Madrid could be fun!
27/12/2024, 12:53 - Vita: good afternoon:) woke up super late, gonna hopefuly get to the gym after this family thing aghh
27/12/2024, 12:53 - Vita: okay so in terms of madrid vs alicante, I’d be happy to check out madrid since I’ve never been! you can show me the spots ;)
27/12/2024, 12:54 - Vita: but tbh i think there’s no loss if:
- a. It’s an arguably cooler place than alicante and
- ⁠b. we won’t lose any time on it (if anything we might gain a bit based on efficiency of trains etc…?)
27/12/2024, 12:54 - Vita: so would be very happy to do that!
27/12/2024, 12:55 - Vita: especially since alicante was kinda more gonna be a stopover for some food and a wander plus maybe a gallery, but with madrid we might get to do and see a little more which would be nice:)
27/12/2024, 12:55 - Vita: again, have never been so am always down to go;)
27/12/2024, 14:45 - Tim Farrelly: Hello!
27/12/2024, 14:45 - Tim Farrelly: Woke up a bit over an hour ago, but not sure if Ive come down with something too:/
27/12/2024, 14:45 - Tim Farrelly: Gonna get up now anyways
27/12/2024, 14:46 - Tim Farrelly: They're keeping sadhbh in hospital anyways. Her heart rate was very high when my mom left her early this morning, but she's in an otherwise stable state and good care. Will hopefully find out later if it's pneumonia or what's going on
27/12/2024, 14:47 - Tim Farrelly: Sweet! Yeah Madrid is a super cool city! It's Spains capital I think after all hahaha
27/12/2024, 14:52 - Tim Farrelly: Also, what are your movements for new years eve?
27/12/2024, 16:13 - Vita: oh no! how are you feeling atm?! I think there’s definitely something going around - I’m not 100% today myself either!
27/12/2024, 16:13 - Vita: okay Im really really glad to hear that they kept her in and that she’s stable
27/12/2024, 16:14 - Vita: do keep me updated, hopefully she gets some imaging done asap
27/12/2024, 16:14 - Vita: true! ahhh I’m actually so excited:) we can discuss more/have a last look at airbnbs later ;)
27/12/2024, 16:15 - Vita: so it looks like my friends and I are possibly gonna be doing a prinks and then popping into mcsoreleys - we went there last year so are hoping to go again, have another few plans circulating but nothing confirmed just yet:) how about yourself?!
27/12/2024, 16:16 - Vita: I might potentially be doing the prinks for mcsoreleys, if that’s the case and you’re able to pop by, I’d love for you to join if you can:)
27/12/2024, 16:16 - Vita: also just in my uncles still! I might try make a quick dash into town for a douche after if I can hehe
27/12/2024, 16:16 - Vita: hows your afternoon been?:)
27/12/2024, 17:18 - Tim Farrelly: aww no:')
27/12/2024, 17:18 - Tim Farrelly: I'm not sure if I do have a flu tbh, feeling a good bit better after I got up at least!
27/12/2024, 17:19 - Tim Farrelly: What do you think you have?
27/12/2024, 17:19 - Tim Farrelly: Just out of an FOV call anyways
27/12/2024, 17:19 - Tim Farrelly: and was plenty coherent for that
27/12/2024, 17:20 - Tim Farrelly: she got an xray taken last night! Going to ring my mom now to find out if the radiologist has given it a look yet
27/12/2024, 17:20 - Tim Farrelly: Sweet! I might actually book the flights out now if that sounds good to you - they've gone up 5 euro since last night!
27/12/2024, 17:21 - Tim Farrelly: is that the place you got hit on an older punk couple hahaha?
27/12/2024, 17:23 - Tim Farrelly: I'm not too sure - but I think I might head down to Wexford hahaha! That guy who you met briefly in pawn shop, and who I saw the stained glass with... his friend has a big house apparently with a class sound system and is going to throw a big party! And then Oisin (my friend) also has a free house down there, so I can sleep over there:) You're welcome to come if you'd like to (Oisin had said)! But if you have plans, no worries at all ofc
27/12/2024, 17:24 - Tim Farrelly: I think that's what I'll be doing anyways - Wexford is something different. Could be a big rave on a country house/ nice farm potentially (there's a big glass room I think he said) hahahah
27/12/2024, 17:25 - Tim Farrelly: just out of a meting with FOV - and gonna grab and run some food now! Sprout is the only open place so think I'll treat myself hehe:)
27/12/2024, 17:25 - Tim Farrelly: And some smoothie ingredients ofc
27/12/2024, 17:26 - Tim Farrelly: did you make it to the gym
27/12/2024, 17:46 - Vita: only home now so no :((( think I really need the workout as well the cramps and pms are off the charts rn hahaha
27/12/2024, 17:46 - Vita: but gonna get out for a walk now
27/12/2024, 17:46 - Vita: what time suits for later btw?
27/12/2024, 17:47 - Vita: oh I’m so glad to hear it! that’d be such a pain, I’ve heard the flu going around atm is really bad as well :(
27/12/2024, 17:48 - Vita: I’m not sure - actually also feeling a good bit better now myself hahaha, was just feeling quite achy and headachy earlier but couldve been dehydration and lack of sleep
27/12/2024, 17:49 - Vita: (the gym is 9-5 til new years so I need to hustle to get in there over the next few days tbh)
27/12/2024, 17:49 - Vita: great! v glad to hear, and hope they get her a CT soon
27/12/2024, 17:50 - Vita: sounds like a plan, count me in!
27/12/2024, 17:51 - Vita: no, thank god not!!! hahaha - mcsoreleys is in ranelagh, I’d say we might be doing the pub quiz there soon so you should definitely join for that if you’re around, it’s a whole lot of fun :)
27/12/2024, 17:52 - Vita: oh sick! that actually sounds unreal, can’t lie I’m very tempted… will have a think about it and get back to you ;) but either way I bet that’ll be such a good night omg
27/12/2024, 17:52 - Vita: :o glass room! like, stained glass..?
27/12/2024, 17:52 - Vita: oooh defo do hehe
27/12/2024, 18:20 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
27/12/2024, 18:20 - Tim Farrelly: Just devoured this delicious thing in potentially record time
27/12/2024, 18:21 - Tim Farrelly: Enjoy! Taking Fred out with you? Is up to doing that yet?
27/12/2024, 18:22 - Tim Farrelly: Ah that's good to hear! I was basically the same this morning, but do definitely have a slight cough now too, and still feeling a bit off (headachy)
27/12/2024, 18:23 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah hopefully! They said they think she could potentially have a clot so that's what's they're working around atm I think
27/12/2024, 18:23 - Vita: I actually popped out to pick up a douchr haha, spoke to my friend and she said if its the first time you need it because you’re not relaxed enough to clean yourself digitally
27/12/2024, 18:24 - Tim Farrelly: She has a very high heart rate, my mom said it was about 150 bpm, which yeah... Not great, but sounds like they're taking really good care of her!
27/12/2024, 18:24 - Vita: oh fuuuuck
27/12/2024, 18:24 - Tim Farrelly: Perfect! Shall do that once I'm home, or will check now actually that they're the same price still

27/12/2024, 18:28 - Tim Farrelly: Can you let me get back to you once I'm home and see how I'm feeling after some food? 

Would love to see you obviously, but I don't want to give you anything, and not sure if I'd be better off just resting! Are you free tmrw evening if not...?
27/12/2024, 18:30 - Vita: hey:) that’s absolutely no bother at all! I totally understand, have your symptoms got worse? :(
27/12/2024, 18:31 - Vita: honestly I also really wanna see you but don’t feel bad if tonight doesnt work, since I wouldnt mind a night in to read and take a big bath so dont feel guilty if you’re not up to it!
27/12/2024, 18:32 - Vita: plus - not that it matters much - but still on my period so there’d be a better chance I’d be finished it tmw haha

28/12/2024, 17:50 - Vita: I’m probably gonna be really tight but I have a feeling it’s gonna feel really good

28/12/2024, 17:55 - Vita: ;) that’s what I like to see
28/12/2024, 17:56 - Tim Farrelly: Deal
28/12/2024, 17:56 - Tim Farrelly: If my texts are brief btw, again, I'm just speechless by how turned on you make me
28/12/2024, 17:58 - Vita: hehehe dw at all, it’s making me really wet thinking about how flustered you are
28/12/2024, 17:58 - Vita: don’t suppose I could be cheeky and ask for a visual on this…? ;)
28/12/2024, 17:58 - Vita: and tbh I just cant stop thinking about how I’m gonna seduce you later
28/12/2024, 18:04 - Tim Farrelly: You may be cheeky;)
28/12/2024, 18:05 - Tim Farrelly: There was indeed quite a bit of pre-cum
28/12/2024, 18:08 - Vita: god fucking damn
28/12/2024, 18:09 - Vita: I cannot wait to feel all that inside me
28/12/2024, 18:09 - Vita: I cannot articulate how badly I want you in this exact moment
28/12/2024, 18:09 - Vita: my body is literally aching for you, tim
28/12/2024, 18:45 - Vita: heading out in a sec here, then will be over:)
28/12/2024, 18:45 - Vita: aoife got your vitamin d btw!
28/12/2024, 18:46 - Vita: it was 7.70 - for simplicity i might just rev her if thats cool:)
28/12/2024, 18:56 - Tim Farrelly: Aww amazing!
28/12/2024, 18:56 - Tim Farrelly: I'll rev you now
28/12/2024, 18:56 - Tim Farrelly: On my laptop rn but will see that pic + rev you soon:)
28/12/2024, 18:56 - Tim Farrelly: Thank her for me!
28/12/2024, 18:58 - Tim Farrelly: Fuuuuck
28/12/2024, 18:58 - Tim Farrelly: Can you send me this - the lighting shows everything so nicely
28/12/2024, 19:00 - Tim Farrelly: Btw - can I assume that you got a flu shot haha?
28/12/2024, 19:03 - Vita: it was 7.70 :)
28/12/2024, 19:03 - Vita: of course!
28/12/2024, 19:03 - Vita: heartbreakingly didnt save it since i was rushing to get changed :,((
28/12/2024, 19:03 - Vita: you can take one later if you wish;)
28/12/2024, 19:11 - Tim Farrelly: rev'd you!
28/12/2024, 19:11 - Tim Farrelly: And look forward to it;)
28/12/2024, 19:46 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
28/12/2024, 19:46 - Tim Farrelly: Tim luck strikes again - hard hehe
28/12/2024, 19:46 - Tim Farrelly: There's guac on the left!!
28/12/2024, 19:46 - Tim Farrelly: And plenty of chicken under the mountain of veg on the right
28/12/2024, 20:50 - Vita: omg! too good to go?!
28/12/2024, 20:51 - Vita: im just finished dinner, gonna grab my bag and head over to you hehe
28/12/2024, 20:51 - Vita: <Media omitted>
28/12/2024, 20:51 - Vita: we also had some very sexy food hehe
28/12/2024, 20:53 - Tim Farrelly: Yep!
28/12/2024, 20:54 - Tim Farrelly: Aww that looks absolutely unreal:)
28/12/2024, 20:54 - Tim Farrelly: It's quite a while since I've had any sushi - I think the last time I got it, it wasn't too nice, but probably time I get it sometime soon!
28/12/2024, 20:55 - Tim Farrelly: We should go to Takara sometime (the place I have my first pseudo gf to thank for showing me!)
28/12/2024, 20:55 - Tim Farrelly: Anyways, looking forward to seeing you!
28/12/2024, 20:56 - Vita: would love to try that out! to add to the list, my friend evan’s boyfriend is brazilian and apparently theres an unreal brazilian sushi place in dublin hehe
28/12/2024, 20:56 - Vita: we should try it some time:)
28/12/2024, 20:56 - Tim Farrelly: Is it ok if you don't sleep over tonight? Probably not a bad idea for minimizing contagion, but mainly, Omar just texted me there an hour ago, will explain later, but I'm going to have to get a good bit of work done this weekend for a deadline, and my golden hours are apparently 1am to 6am atm lol
28/12/2024, 20:57 - Tim Farrelly: Oh very interesting!
28/12/2024, 20:57 - Tim Farrelly: Takara + the Brazilian sushi place
28/12/2024, 20:58 - Vita: wait so were you planning on working instead?
28/12/2024, 20:58 - Vita: tbh em I’m not sure?
28/12/2024, 20:58 - Vita: sorry hahaha
28/12/2024, 20:58 - Vita: like obviously get the work done!

28/12/2024, 21:22 - Tim Farrelly: Hey have you left yet ?
28/12/2024, 21:23 - Tim Farrelly: Does your laptop have an SD card slot?
28/12/2024, 21:23 - Tim Farrelly: or a usb slot?
28/12/2024, 21:26 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>

28/12/2024, 21:27 - Vita: haha nw, about to leave in a few here
28/12/2024, 21:27 - Tim Farrelly: Will only need it for a few mins to set something up!
28/12/2024, 21:27 - Tim Farrelly: Can do that later tho:)
28/12/2024, 21:27 - Tim Farrelly: My adapter isn't cooperating unfortunately

28/12/2024, 21:51 - Vita: plus will leave you to do your work, will just tell my parents you’re sick and thought it best not to stay!
28/12/2024, 21:53 - Tim Farrelly: Ok! Ah didn't realise he's going off to see Hannah's fam - hope he enjoys
28/12/2024, 21:54 - Tim Farrelly: and sounds good! I look forward to have a full wholesome day and night with you sometime very soon:)
28/12/2024, 21:54 - Tim Farrelly: We should 100% get to the Hugh Lane before too long!

28/12/2024, 21:55 - Vita: yes! we will definitely do this soon! and anora at the ifi!

29/12/2024, 04:26 - Tim Farrelly: https://x.com/uberstuber/status/1873151009364820234

29/12/2024, 14:10 - Vita: <Media omitted>
29/12/2024, 14:10 - Vita: <Media omitted>
29/12/2024, 14:11 - Vita: exhibit 1: you are having an indelible effect on my youtube recommended page hehe
exhibit 2: zucc is listening
29/12/2024, 17:03 - Tim Farrelly: Hello!
29/12/2024, 17:04 - Tim Farrelly: I got a very good sleep lol
29/12/2024, 17:04 - Tim Farrelly: Got to sleep around 4.40 I think - earlier than it has been!
29/12/2024, 17:04 - Tim Farrelly: But only woke up at 3, and got out of bed a bit later
29/12/2024, 17:04 - Tim Farrelly: Back from a yoghurt pickup and such hehe
29/12/2024, 17:04 - Tim Farrelly: Ordered another Too Good to Go for later!
29/12/2024, 17:04 - Tim Farrelly: My appetite is definitely lower than usual though
29/12/2024, 17:05 - Tim Farrelly: Amazing!!! I'll be searching this up hehe
29/12/2024, 17:05 - Tim Farrelly: Omnipotent
29/12/2024, 17:05 - Tim Farrelly: Zucc is
29/12/2024, 17:27 - Vita: hi hi:) I’m just back from the gym! had a lovely little back and abs sesh
29/12/2024, 17:28 - Vita: sitting down with the brothers karamazov again hehe
29/12/2024, 17:28 - Vita: enjoying the last of the christmas tree :,)
29/12/2024, 17:28 - Vita: amazing! this we love to see
29/12/2024, 17:29 - Vita: I feel like once you’re back to regularly going to bed at 3/4 it’ll somewhat be closer to your prior routine just slightly on the later end of things
29/12/2024, 17:29 - Vita: oooh do keep me updated if there’s guac involved!
29/12/2024, 17:30 - Vita: theres a sprout around the corner from me i need to keep an eye on their toogoodtogo for post-gym snacks, although they tend to have funny hours possibly because they mostly cater to office staff
29/12/2024, 17:31 - Vita: hahahaha it’s the sort of thing I’d put on in the background while eating or something, despite not ever having seen a single episode of south park
29/12/2024, 18:38 - Vita: <Media omitted>
29/12/2024, 18:38 - Vita: <Media omitted>
29/12/2024, 18:38 - Vita: <Media omitted>
29/12/2024, 18:39 - Vita: cooking for the fam tmw for the first time in awhile (as in properly, trying new recipes hehe) - v excited to make this sexy little assortment of dishes!
29/12/2024, 18:41 - Vita: <Media omitted>
29/12/2024, 20:27 - Tim Farrelly: I didn't realize, but my parents are just telling me that apparently sadhbhs heart rate was stupidly high each time she had been in the GP before with her lungs. But again, left it at that. 

The 2nd last time, they had called my mom to pick her up as her heart rate was too high

Just again, not happy with the GP 📉📉. If it'd been 150bpm (my dad is going there for himself tmrw, has had flu like symptoms for a few weeks, and will hopefully find out what it was), along with serious breathing difficulties, like it was at the hospital, I don't see how that's not malpractice not calling her an ambulance immediately
29/12/2024, 20:29 - Tim Farrelly: Just called my mom (down with a nasty flu unfortunately), and just very not happy to hear about sadhbhs heart rate being so high and the GPs just sending her home
29/12/2024, 20:30 - Tim Farrelly: Do you have long left?
29/12/2024, 20:30 - Tim Farrelly: Trinitys is still up in front square!
29/12/2024, 20:30 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah no that's spot on hahah
29/12/2024, 20:31 - Tim Farrelly: I just want to get back to waking up around 11-12 I think
29/12/2024, 20:31 - Tim Farrelly: There's guac!! Albeit, no chicken:')
29/12/2024, 20:31 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
29/12/2024, 20:31 - Tim Farrelly: Still so much food and very tasty! And I have Choco milk for protein:)
29/12/2024, 20:31 - Tim Farrelly: Ah gotcha
29/12/2024, 20:32 - Tim Farrelly: You're making all of this!? Looks incredible
29/12/2024, 21:39 - Tim Farrelly: Fancy potentially seeing this?

https://ifi.ie/film/the-brutalist/

would be on the 23rd
29/12/2024, 21:40 - Tim Farrelly: do you have drawing then?
29/12/2024, 21:40 - Tim Farrelly: ah should be generally released after the 24th!
29/12/2024, 22:31 - Vita: hey:) was just watching a movie with the fam hehe
29/12/2024, 22:31 - Vita: oscars last night, was lovely!
29/12/2024, 22:32 - Vita: yeah sorry this is absolutely appalling practise - they shouldve got at least an ecg and referred her for 24 hour ecg monitoring in addition to a cardiology referral if every other cause was ruled out (and obviously they didnt even *attempt* to rule out other causes)
29/12/2024, 22:33 - Vita: tim I do genuinely think it’s worth reporting to the medical council at that rate
29/12/2024, 22:33 - Vita: I know you’re going to already
29/12/2024, 22:33 - Vita: but like the level of incompetence just keeps rising with everything you’re telling me hahaha
29/12/2024, 22:33 - Vita: if you wanna chat or rant about it at any stage lmk, it’s absolutely appalling to hear about
29/12/2024, 22:35 - Vita: less than two hours! will be finished it this evening methinks, just about to get back into it :,)
29/12/2024, 22:35 - Vita: yeah absolutely, if you can set an alarm to get to bed 30 mins earlier every night that’d probs help as well just to gradually reset :,)
29/12/2024, 22:35 - Vita: okay I need to get in on this holy shit
29/12/2024, 22:36 - Vita: the guac looks fucking bangingggg
29/12/2024, 22:36 - Vita: I am indeed ;)
29/12/2024, 22:36 - Vita: will send plenty of pics!
29/12/2024, 22:36 - Vita: havent tried any of the recipes before, but if they’re adequately tasty you can expect to sample them soon ;)
29/12/2024, 22:37 - Vita: yeah I do :( I was getting excited seeing the other dates but then realised we’re away then!
29/12/2024, 22:38 - Vita: but I’d absolutely love to see that
29/12/2024, 22:38 - Vita: would be down to go on the 24th though:)
29/12/2024, 22:38 - Vita: we could go see it in the IFI or the lighthouse potentially depending on where it’s being screened?!
29/12/2024, 22:41 - Tim Farrelly: being productive! text in a bit
29/12/2024, 23:30 - Tim Farrelly: just booked in a battery replacement for Thursday!
29/12/2024, 23:30 - Tim Farrelly: ah glad to hear!
29/12/2024, 23:30 - Tim Farrelly: what did you guys watch?
29/12/2024, 23:31 - Tim Farrelly: yeah no its not great - will be reporting once I'm able to get all the information straight. Hoping Jim can request Sadhbhs medical records tmrw, or wait till sadhbh is out of hospital and well and can ask for them herself (I assume they'll have logged her BPM there when she visited and what they did with her?)
29/12/2024, 23:32 - Tim Farrelly: ah fantastic!
29/12/2024, 23:32 - Tim Farrelly: (for my phone)
29/12/2024, 23:32 - Tim Farrelly: not a bad idea! I'm quite productive now since about 10pm, but I think if I get up earlier id just head to the library/ Dogpatch, and would be more productive from earlier in the day
29/12/2024, 23:33 - Tim Farrelly: it should be on regularly after the 24th!
29/12/2024, 23:33 - Tim Farrelly: yeah more info should be released soon on dates anyways!
29/12/2024, 23:34 - Tim Farrelly: I remember seeing that it blew away the crowd in Cannes or palme dor or one of those things
30/12/2024, 00:32 - Vita: love to see it! you working on fov or thesis stuff tn? :)
30/12/2024, 00:32 - Vita: ah amazing!
30/12/2024, 00:33 - Vita: love to see it x2 hehe
30/12/2024, 00:33 - Vita: and we watched a film called cruel intentions, it was made in the 90s - was somewhat entertaining but an absolute mess of a plot line and heavily relied on shock value hahaha
30/12/2024, 00:34 - Vita: also contained an sufficiently awkward amount of incest for family viewing💀
30/12/2024, 00:35 - Vita: yes one would hope, honestly I think seeing their record keeping will also be interesting because I have a feeling they wouldnt be the best for it considering their management of patients….
30/12/2024, 00:35 - Vita: but hopefully there’ll be sufficient info to prove they werent following up adequately
30/12/2024, 00:36 - Vita: there definitely will be, and tbh it will look even worse for them if there arent good notes
30/12/2024, 00:36 - Vita: sounds like a plan! next time I’m over I’ll try remember to bring some cherry juice if I can find any, it boosts melatonin production so would help you sleep better earlier:)
30/12/2024, 00:37 - Vita: oooh then we really must go!
30/12/2024, 00:37 - Vita: movies in theatre atm or soon we need to see: 
- anora 
- ⁠the brutalist
30/12/2024, 00:37 - Vita: (starred this for future reference for us ;) )
30/12/2024, 01:52 - Vita: heading to bed now! night night :) xx
30/12/2024, 02:26 - Vita: actually no I lied I’m *actually* gonna go to bed now - finished the brothers karamazov! the last chapter made me cry a lot hahaha but it was excellent
30/12/2024, 02:26 - Vita: anyway gn for real now!
30/12/2024, 05:36 - Tim Farrelly: its actually unreasonable how effective and productive I am at this hour atm lmao
30/12/2024, 05:36 - Tim Farrelly: https://www.hackireland.com/

open this on your laptop and hover your mouse over the apply now button ;)
30/12/2024, 05:37 - Tim Farrelly: going to add that effect to the sponsor section another time, but needs to be more efficient/ optimized for being over a larger space/ I need a bit more time with it
30/12/2024, 05:37 - Tim Farrelly: https://youtube-sort-by-likes.vercel.app/

Made this - put in any youtube channel you like
30/12/2024, 05:38 - Tim Farrelly: and now going to get back to some FOV work in a min once I finish some stuff with the youtube thing lmao
30/12/2024, 05:38 - Tim Farrelly: starting tmrw I'll get to bed earlier. I'm feeling much better though so might try for 7.5 hours of sleep and set strict alarms. Goal is to wake up before 2.30:)
30/12/2024, 07:04 - Tim Farrelly: Shall aim for 4am tmrw lol. I think I'll try get my "work day" done much earlier and head to dogpatch/ library if it's open, then watch a movie at 2am
30/12/2024, 07:04 - Tim Farrelly: Was mad productive tonight nonetheless
30/12/2024, 07:04 - Tim Farrelly: Let me know what you think of this!
30/12/2024, 07:04 - Tim Farrelly: Ah just seeing I'll need to fix it for mobile (just aesthetically)
30/12/2024, 07:06 - Tim Farrelly: Please remind me to have a convo with ChatGPT about night shifts/ late nights - please!
30/12/2024, 12:34 - Vita: only on my phone rn so pinning this to look at later when i have my laptop on me!!! :)
30/12/2024, 12:35 - Vita: very cool! and handy for getting into new content. I like that you included a like-to-view ratio - I tried it out with a couple of channels and it was interesting to see the disparities!
30/12/2024, 12:36 - Vita: TIMMMM NOT THE 7am BEDTIME 💀💀
30/12/2024, 12:37 - Vita: but yes this sounds like a shout hahaha
30/12/2024, 12:38 - Vita: yeah I think going off a slight sleep deficit might help you get to bed sooner! so definitely start with that and see how you go:)
30/12/2024, 12:39 - Vita: idk if you made any changes aesthetically last night but it looks pretty great to me tbh :,)
30/12/2024, 12:40 - Vita: yes 100% do this! I asked them out of curiosity after seeing this message and it confirmed your brain fog and forgetfulness are most likely linked to your irregular sleeping hours
30/12/2024, 12:40 - Vita: (just when we’re chatting and you forget what you wanted to say, for example)
30/12/2024, 12:42 - Vita: also, when suits to hang out and do something next? I wont be seeing you til the new year it seems so let me know what works!
30/12/2024, 12:43 - Vita: also was very horny last night/this morning thinking about you hehe
30/12/2024, 12:47 - Vita: was just thinking how hot it’d be to show up at your place some time wearing only stockings and red lipstick under a big coat
30/12/2024, 12:50 - Vita: and was thinking about how good the sex the other night was, and how hard you were - oh tim the things I’d do to you if you were in bed with me rn
30/12/2024, 12:58 - Vita: you really could have me any way you want;)
30/12/2024, 13:00 - Vita: I’m so unspeakably wet right now thinking about you, and your strong hands running over the curves of my body while you fuck me so hard
30/12/2024, 13:00 - Vita: I think you’d probably go insane if you felt me right now
30/12/2024, 13:01 - Vita: anyway I should probably get up and going, but hope you like the pics;)
30/12/2024, 13:01 - Vita: if you wake up hard, just saying I wouldnt mind seeing what I’m missing out on ;)
30/12/2024, 18:46 - Tim Farrelly: Hello!
30/12/2024, 18:46 - Tim Farrelly: I just got up around 4 lol
30/12/2024, 18:47 - Tim Farrelly: Got a nice big walk immediately to get some sunlight anyways! And showered once I got back
30/12/2024, 18:48 - Tim Farrelly: Have had some food, and just chilling in bed scrolling on my phone for a bit, about to get stuck into work now though - being fully serious when I say I've discovered the secret to my focus is really just listening to good techno with noise cancelling headphones lmao
30/12/2024, 18:48 - Tim Farrelly: Like it's insane
30/12/2024, 18:48 - Tim Farrelly: ATM at least hahaha
30/12/2024, 18:48 - Tim Farrelly: Will fix it for mobile now soon!
30/12/2024, 18:49 - Tim Farrelly: Vita, ngl, i think it was closer to 9 when I eventually fully fell asleep 😭
30/12/2024, 18:49 - Tim Farrelly: I used your eye mask hahaha (thank you)
30/12/2024, 18:49 - Tim Farrelly: I had just lots of ideas... Unfortunately forgotten a good few of them, but...
30/12/2024, 18:50 - Tim Farrelly: I think a great side project for me would be to build the world's largest art dataset
30/12/2024, 18:50 - Tim Farrelly: I'd need funding, but a sort of digital library of Alexandria for art
30/12/2024, 18:50 - Tim Farrelly: (limiting to art by artists who's work has been in museums or galleries I guess - as there's loads of digital+AI art out there(
30/12/2024, 18:51 - Tim Farrelly: But I think that could be pretty cool, and kinda extends on my thesis + stained glass map
30/12/2024, 18:51 - Tim Farrelly: There were more ideas... I was too tired to write them down, but ah well. I might download one of the Sleep Talking apps so I can just say them aloud
30/12/2024, 18:52 - Tim Farrelly: Got less than 7 hours id say so hopefully helps! Feeling rested tho:)
30/12/2024, 18:53 - Tim Farrelly: Sadhbh has no clot btw!! They'd been pumping her full of thinners the last couple days - not sure if they would have sorted the clot/ not leaved a trace. But yeah, potentially just a very bad lung infection. 

She's gonna see a lung person before she leaves anyways, and get to the bottom of things:)
30/12/2024, 18:53 - Tim Farrelly: Oh and their projector arrived!
30/12/2024, 18:54 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah I know I know hahaha
30/12/2024, 18:54 - Tim Farrelly: Will have a chat later - that's probably legit
30/12/2024, 18:54 - Tim Farrelly: I need to sort out my plans for tmrw for getting to Wexford, but if I'm home on new years day, wanna do something then? Might get back to you to confirm tho!
30/12/2024, 18:55 - Tim Farrelly: You kinda have to do this
30/12/2024, 18:55 - Tim Farrelly: Hehe
30/12/2024, 18:55 - Tim Farrelly: Those pics were so hot btw - gonna kinda skip over that now tho as I don't want to get horny before getting stuck into work hahah
30/12/2024, 18:55 - Tim Farrelly: How's your day?
30/12/2024, 20:18 - Vita: okay this is diabolical hahaha
30/12/2024, 20:19 - Vita: I’m glad you somewhat limited your sleep time in order to get to bed earlier tonight, but I cant even lie 9 is shocking😭😭
30/12/2024, 20:19 - Vita: do you think you’d pull an all nighter and take a day or two off work at some stage in order to reset?
30/12/2024, 20:20 - Vita: hehehe this is a good formula tho;)
30/12/2024, 20:20 - Vita: use it whenever when i’m not there! you’re welcome to it
30/12/2024, 20:21 - Vita: that’d be super sick! do you think it’s more of a long term project or would you start working on it in conjunction with your thesis??
30/12/2024, 20:22 - Vita: really glad she’ll get to see resp before she leaves, that’ll make things much clearer. as for a clot being dissolved it’s entirely possible, but that’d depend on the whole clinical picture and what her coagulation screen was like over the weekend
30/12/2024, 20:23 - Vita: aw wonderful! everythings coming up milhouse :,)
30/12/2024, 20:23 - Vita: yes 100% boosting this!! this is your reminder to ask chatgpt about it!
30/12/2024, 20:24 - Vita: that’d be lovely! even if you dont make it up to dublin til the evening, we could watch a movie that night and then go on a date the next day?!
30/12/2024, 20:24 - Vita: but yeah keep me posted
30/12/2024, 20:24 - Vita: would be nice to see you:)
30/12/2024, 20:25 - Vita: aww thank you :,) pity you had to skip over them but i understand the grind comes first lol. hopefully you got some pleasure out of them;)
30/12/2024, 20:26 - Vita: good! did loads of driving practise, drove the parents down to avoca kilmacanogue and had coffee and a walk! then just been taking it easy, cooked dinner and heading out to meet my friends at a new board game bar in a few:)
30/12/2024, 20:26 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
30/12/2024, 20:26 - Tim Farrelly: This is the latest magic potion for focus
30/12/2024, 20:27 - Tim Farrelly: Ooo fantastic! Enjoy! Is that the girls - or a larger group?
30/12/2024, 20:27 - Vita: i was in the middle of making an insane ottolenghi feast for my parents and then they had to run out the door, so currently eating half of that alone before i head out haha
30/12/2024, 20:27 - Tim Farrelly: Shall text you later - I'm trying to decide on Wexford
30/12/2024, 20:27 - Vita: i didnt end up making all the dishes because they had to head out so having a pared down version rn
30/12/2024, 20:27 - Vita: its just me, emma, owen and henry plus maybe charlie and david!
30/12/2024, 20:28 - Tim Farrelly: Would love to go down, but I'm still not 100%. Also a friend is hosting a thing in howth which would be logistically very easy and know more people there. But I did commit to wexford
30/12/2024, 20:28 - Tim Farrelly: Wexford would def be fun
30/12/2024, 20:29 - Tim Farrelly: Should be better completely by tmrw I'd say!
30/12/2024, 20:32 - Vita: hmm tbf though committing aside you are sick atm, so like if thats the case and you decide to go howth you could just tell your mate that you’re a bit under the weather and would rather stick in dub for nye? i think that’d be understandable
30/12/2024, 20:33 - Vita: but at the same time wexford sounds absolutely amazing
30/12/2024, 20:33 - Vita: but just to let you know that you do have a very reasonable out should you need it lol
30/12/2024, 20:57 - Vita: also if we do meet up new years day we should book our train to valencia!!
30/12/2024, 20:57 - Tim Farrelly: appreciate it!
30/12/2024, 20:57 - Tim Farrelly: Going to set a timer for 40 mins to decide on it - and work in the meantime
30/12/2024, 20:58 - Tim Farrelly: And I've used this to find some *heavyyyyy* sets
30/12/2024, 20:58 - Tim Farrelly: I might end up using this daily or weekly I think
30/12/2024, 20:58 - Tim Farrelly: I might actually extend it now to look past at more videos
30/12/2024, 20:58 - Tim Farrelly: its only looking at a channel's most recent 50 atm
30/12/2024, 20:59 - Tim Farrelly: ive fixed it more mobile now btw
30/12/2024, 22:32 - Tim Farrelly: text ya fully later but yeah I think I'll stay in Dub for nye's. Going to text Oisin now
30/12/2024, 22:34 - Tim Farrelly: I'll be out in Howth early in the evening, but I think I'll try get the last bus/ train back into town. What would you think if I caught up with you after then?
30/12/2024, 23:09 - Vita: just out atm! but re: nye would this mean you’d be back in town on new years eve?
30/12/2024, 23:09 - Vita: or rather in the early hours of jan first if youre doing nye in howth?
30/12/2024, 23:11 - Vita: unfortunately I probs wouldnt be able to catch up with you / meet you in the early hours of jan first because mary is staying at mine that night! but I’d be able to meet you the next day or else you’d be more than welcome to join me at mine for the night! but just couldnt be abandoning her if shes staying hahaha
30/12/2024, 23:11 - Vita: so what would you think of meeting up on new years day during the day, or otherwise coming to mine after last bus depending on what suits?
30/12/2024, 23:12 - Vita: no pressure on either! just lmk x
30/12/2024, 23:13 - Tim Farrelly: Looks like the late night darts and buses only go from town outwards, not the other way round unfortunately, so will either be around 10ish or ill be getting a taxi back out later
30/12/2024, 23:14 - Tim Farrelly: ahh no worries! And yeah ofc!
30/12/2024, 23:14 - Tim Farrelly: I'll get back to you tmrw most likely or later:)
30/12/2024, 23:15 - Tim Farrelly: But if I can sleep over at yours, that'd probably be nice! I'll get back to you to confirm though
30/12/2024, 23:16 - Tim Farrelly: Looks like the hugh lane is open as it normally owuld be on new years! 

https://hughlane.ie/2024/12/06/2024-hlg-christmas-opening-hours/
31/12/2024, 00:21 - Vita: yes you’re so welcome to! just keep me in the loop re: your movements anyway:)
31/12/2024, 00:22 - Vita: would be lovely to see you tomorrow evening if at all possible! but no pressure anyway, nye is always hectic so just lmk x
31/12/2024, 00:22 - Vita: ahhh amazing :,)
31/12/2024, 00:23 - Vita: finally hehehe
31/12/2024, 00:25 - Vita: <Media omitted>
31/12/2024, 00:25 - Tim Farrelly: How was your evening btw?
31/12/2024, 00:26 - Vita: lovely! but my docs have officially defeated me:(
31/12/2024, 00:26 - Tim Farrelly: Thanks for clarifying! This sounds good!!
31/12/2024, 00:26 - Tim Farrelly: oh no:')
31/12/2024, 00:26 - Tim Farrelly: it was inevitable dare I say
31/12/2024, 00:26 - Vita: came home to some very very sore ankles - your blister patches are working wonders currently!
31/12/2024, 00:27 - Tim Farrelly: whip out those blister things and be amazed!
31/12/2024, 00:27 - Tim Farrelly: ah fantastic!
31/12/2024, 00:27 - Tim Farrelly: Wait till you have to put shoes on again - they're really so good
31/12/2024, 00:27 - Vita: theyre so good!!! i was worried i wont be able to wear my docs out tmw but this is giving me hope!
31/12/2024, 00:27 - Vita: okay amazing :)
31/12/2024, 00:28 - Tim Farrelly: I'm about to head out for a quick walk and listen to an audio book I think, and then come back and do some more work. Just trying to finish up a timeline of what my year looks like for Patch rn, it'll probably be within the next week that I'll start working on that
31/12/2024, 00:28 - Vita: i re-read that message and realised it sounded like i wouldnt be able to meet you hahaha which is simply not the case
31/12/2024, 00:28 - Vita: but rather just that if we’re to meet up that we’ll have to stay at mine bc of mary!
31/12/2024, 00:28 - Tim Farrelly: bring some spare patches with you to slap on during the evening in case any more pop up!
31/12/2024, 00:28 - Tim Farrelly: sounds good!
31/12/2024, 00:28 - Vita: I certainly will ;) ty for the tip hehe
31/12/2024, 00:29 - Vita: oooh v nice:) what book are you listening to atm?!
31/12/2024, 00:30 - Vita: I’m having a cup of tea here and then gonna head to bed - have a feeling tmw will be fairly hectic since I’m supposedly meeting the girls, doing a drive, working out, and making nibbles for everyone coming here for prinks, as well as hosting prinks and doing a bunch of household chores
31/12/2024, 00:30 - Vita: all very nice chill manageable stuff bit just a long list for the day hehe
31/12/2024, 00:41 - Tim Farrelly: masters of doom hahaha
31/12/2024, 00:41 - Tim Farrelly: very misleading title
31/12/2024, 00:41 - Tim Farrelly: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_Doom
31/12/2024, 00:42 - Tim Farrelly: Its about the John Carmack and John Romero. Two legendary programmers and their early days of building truly revolutionary video games
31/12/2024, 00:42 - Tim Farrelly: Its really good so far! Suits audio format very well which is lovely - its a very long time snice I've listened and enjoyed an audiobook but this is good
31/12/2024, 00:43 - Vita: hahahaha fr i thought it was about oppenheimer or something similar at first
31/12/2024, 00:43 - Tim Farrelly: how are you feeling btw? looks like oyu're immune to my flu?
31/12/2024, 00:43 - Vita: seems so 😎😎
31/12/2024, 00:43 - Tim Farrelly: a good kinda hectic though it sounds like!
31/12/2024, 00:43 - Vita: yesss I’m v excited to make all the snacks and nibbles for the nye prinks!
31/12/2024, 00:44 - Vita: sticking to the classics ofc, honey dijon cocktail sausages and filo brie bites with cranberry sauce
31/12/2024, 00:44 - Vita: aww I’m so glad to hear:) is it read by the author?
31/12/2024, 00:44 - Vita: but feeling good! was quite tired earlier on but think it was just bc i had a hard time getting to sleep last night (was horny lol)
31/12/2024, 00:45 - Vita: and then woke up horny 😔
31/12/2024, 00:45 - Vita: god gives his strongest soldiers his hardest battles
31/12/2024, 00:49 - Tim Farrelly: no but its actually read by one of my fav readers hahaha
31/12/2024, 00:49 - Tim Farrelly: he's done some other programming/ tech bios before haha
31/12/2024, 00:50 - Tim Farrelly: hahahaha you poor thing. I'll be sure to help you out tmrw;)
31/12/2024, 00:50 - Tim Farrelly: you sound like a great host!
31/12/2024, 00:58 - Vita: aw amazing! this is actually one thing which i find hard about audio books actually - the mixed bag that is that of narrators hahaha
31/12/2024, 00:58 - Vita: so v glad you have a good voice reading it;)
31/12/2024, 00:59 - Vita: hehehe thank you kindly;) starting off the new year right hehe
31/12/2024, 00:59 - Vita: aww hardly :,) i havent hosted in ages actually, so just doing my bit!
31/12/2024, 01:00 - Vita: plus the girls always pop off with the food so the bar is high hehe
31/12/2024, 01:00 - Vita: gonna head to bed now though:) just been sitting on the couch texting people about the plan for tmw!
31/12/2024, 01:02 - Vita: oh also!
31/12/2024, 01:03 - Vita: just so you’re aware, was playing around with the hackireland website on mobile (still havent got a chance to look on my laptop yet!)
31/12/2024, 01:04 - Vita: <Media omitted>
31/12/2024, 01:04 - Vita: and your to-do list comes up when you click into your github hahaha
31/12/2024, 01:04 - Vita: just wanted to say in case you werent aware, obviously it’s completely benign but wasnt sure if you knew!
31/12/2024, 01:05 - Vita: website is looking sick though:)
31/12/2024, 01:05 - Vita: anyway, gonna head to bed now! hope you’re not up til 9am tonight ;)
31/12/2024, 01:06 - Vita: lemme know how you get on, really looking forward to hopefully seeing you tmw!
31/12/2024, 01:20 - Tim Farrelly: Ah thanks for letting me know! Should just be temporary! Its fine to be up there for now
31/12/2024, 01:20 - Tim Farrelly: I would send you a screen recording from my laptop here now but that's quite non-trivial on windows unfortunately hahaha
31/12/2024, 01:20 - Tim Farrelly: wait a min - i downloaded some good open source software for that a bit ago
31/12/2024, 01:23 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
31/12/2024, 01:23 - Tim Farrelly: main thing is to watch my mouse move across the apply now button!
31/12/2024, 01:23 - Tim Farrelly: soooooooo sexy
31/12/2024, 01:23 - Tim Farrelly: im popping it off with design lately if I may say so hehe
31/12/2024, 03:02 - Tim Farrelly: also, remind me, I *need* to do the Trinity Sex Survey this semester lol
31/12/2024, 03:02 - Tim Farrelly: its gonna be my last semester, so last chance
31/12/2024, 03:02 - Tim Farrelly: would be a tad weird if I was to do this as a grad/ alumni lol
31/12/2024, 03:02 - Tim Farrelly: (ie already graduated)
31/12/2024, 03:03 - Tim Farrelly: but I think would be interesting + so funny (not the results of the survey exactly, just the fact that I did it, and hopefully I get a decent response rate)
31/12/2024, 03:14 - Tim Farrelly: (ok have written a plan and a reminder - need to make a poster, reach out to Trinity News, ask if they'll help cover poster printing costs, and then that's pretty much it:) )
31/12/2024, 03:14 - Tim Farrelly: Have the editor on Whatsapp from a groupchat so that's nice and easy!
31/12/2024, 03:31 - Tim Farrelly: Ooo and I could get Tringe et al to repost potentially 👀
31/12/2024, 03:35 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
31/12/2024, 03:35 - Tim Farrelly: Tonight's potion
31/12/2024, 03:36 - Tim Farrelly: Gonna finish up soon tho!
31/12/2024, 13:03 - Vita: good afternoon! only getting out of bed now hahaha current order appears to be around 11 hours of sleep
31/12/2024, 13:03 - Vita: but have people coming at 6 so gotta get to it!
31/12/2024, 13:03 - Vita: but this is absolutely so so sexy
31/12/2024, 13:03 - Vita: oh my lord
31/12/2024, 13:04 - Vita: hehehe you certainly have
31/12/2024, 13:05 - Vita: oh unreal! that should certainly make things a bit easier hehe
31/12/2024, 13:06 - Vita: let me know when you’re designing it, I really wanna see what questions you’re asking and the data points!
31/12/2024, 13:08 - Vita: no completely - and in a way good that you have that as a deadline for yourself! means you’ll have a better chance of getting it done efficiently
31/12/2024, 13:10 - Vita: ooh that’d be great, would probs get a lot of extra submissions via that!
31/12/2024, 16:13 - Tim Farrelly: Ah love that for you hahaha
31/12/2024, 16:13 - Tim Farrelly: Reminder: please tire me out later tonight
31/12/2024, 16:13 - Tim Farrelly: It took me a while to get to sleep last night, I'm just getting lots of ideas/ thoughts in bed
31/12/2024, 16:13 - Tim Farrelly: I think it's because I've basically been in this room for the last while, and otherwise just getting out for a walk
31/12/2024, 16:14 - Tim Farrelly: Today will fix that anyways
31/12/2024, 16:14 - Tim Farrelly: I'm just out of bed, had an alarm set for 2.30 but slept in till now hahaha, I'll have to set multiple back to back alarms I think going forward
31/12/2024, 16:14 - Tim Farrelly: (I'm still not quite 100%, but much better, so that might be a factor
31/12/2024, 16:15 - Tim Farrelly: Will do!
31/12/2024, 16:16 - Tim Farrelly: Did you get everything pretty much ready/ in place?
31/12/2024, 16:35 - Tim Farrelly: https://youtu.be/Hy52NTKMCPo?si=q8hyZKp_kxuAA1xg
31/12/2024, 17:26 - Tim Farrelly: The brain fog is real📉📉📉
31/12/2024, 17:26 - Vita: HAHAHAHA
31/12/2024, 17:26 - Tim Farrelly: Starting tonight, waking up earlier
31/12/2024, 17:26 - Vita: you shouldve done this on our first date xx
31/12/2024, 17:27 - Tim Farrelly: Hahahaha that's amazing isn't it!!!
31/12/2024, 17:27 - Vita: ahhh almost, local tesco didnt have a bunch of stuff so aoifes bringing a fair amount over!
31/12/2024, 17:27 - Tim Farrelly: The pirate guy has broken through the matrixc
31/12/2024, 17:27 - Vita: she’s saving me fr
31/12/2024, 17:27 - Tim Farrelly: Ab brill
31/12/2024, 17:27 - Vita: oh nooo :((
31/12/2024, 17:27 - Vita: tbf it sounds like your basal activity levels are suffering in addition to everything else
31/12/2024, 17:28 - Vita: which defo cant help any brain fog etc
31/12/2024, 17:28 - Vita: I certainly, certainly will ;)
31/12/2024, 17:29 - Tim Farrelly: Googled this and not s clear answer - what's basal activity?
31/12/2024, 17:29 - Tim Farrelly: (should've chatgpt'd!)
31/12/2024, 17:30 - Vita: oh just like your baseline of how many steps/how much exercise you do!
31/12/2024, 17:30 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah! Tbf, gym is closed, and I've been too unwell for it or running anyways
31/12/2024, 17:30 - Tim Farrelly: Ah gotcha
31/12/2024, 17:30 - Vita: since you’re in your room you’re not out and about like usual which cant help the sleep cycle yknow?
31/12/2024, 17:30 - Tim Farrelly: Oh yeah definitely
31/12/2024, 17:30 - Vita: but listen, it’ll be fixed soon😮‍💨
31/12/2024, 17:31 - Vita: once I’m finished with you;)
31/12/2024, 17:31 - Tim Farrelly: I've been to sure to get out for at least one good walk anyways! But that's farrrrr below my normal
31/12/2024, 17:31 - Tim Farrelly: Norm*
31/12/2024, 17:31 - Tim Farrelly: Hehe can't wait
31/12/2024, 17:31 - Tim Farrelly: For my health ofc
31/12/2024, 17:32 - Vita: you’re not getting any cardio🥺
31/12/2024, 17:32 - Vita: atm anyway
31/12/2024, 17:32 - Vita: so obviously i have to step in🥺
31/12/2024, 17:35 - Tim Farrelly: Really appreciate you looking out for my cardiovascular health 👉👈
31/12/2024, 17:35 - Tim Farrelly: Btw, sadhbhs coming out of the hospital today!
31/12/2024, 17:35 - Tim Farrelly: Will call now and see if they found out what was going on with their lungs
31/12/2024, 17:35 - Tim Farrelly: There's fireworks on in howth at 8, so will try be home for that, then heading for gavs around 9

31/12/2024, 17:49 - Tim Farrelly: New GP tidbit✨

"Shouldn't use inhalers, they're expensive and bad for the environment, as much as driving down to Cork and back"
31/12/2024, 17:50 - Tim Farrelly: Please ask Natasha if there's anyone she'd recommend around Sutton/ howth when she's back hahahaha
31/12/2024, 17:51 - Tim Farrelly: The hospital is basically going to act as sadhbhs GP for the next 6 months anyways - they're booking everything for her and such (apparently this is what the GPs are usually supposed to do? The hospital is taking it on anyways, really were not impressed with GPs)
31/12/2024, 18:24 - Vita: <Media omitted>
31/12/2024, 18:25 - Tim Farrelly: Ahh

31/12/2024, 18:28 - Vita: and to hear this, yeah the GPs really did a number it sounds like
31/12/2024, 18:28 - Vita: SORRY WHAT
31/12/2024, 18:28 - Vita: BRUH💀
31/12/2024, 18:28 - Vita: is the gp really old or something?
31/12/2024, 18:29 - Vita: like not being ageist but they have the wacky ideas consistent with someone practising for years with no oversee
31/12/2024, 18:30 - Vita: oooh v exciting!!

31/12/2024, 18:32 - Tim Farrelly: Not even! Late 40s. I know he's vegan -  he could potentially be an extreme vegan/ climate type... Idk

01/01/2025, 18:41 - Tim Farrelly: This is hard to describe, but my dick feels at peace and content hehe
01/01/2025, 18:41 - Tim Farrelly: Very good sex, as always, but a particularly good blowjob
01/01/2025, 18:41 - Tim Farrelly: I think I'll read Sally Rooney on my phone! Forgot the book unfortunately
01/01/2025, 19:03 - Vita: aww most wonderful to hear:) enjoy the roast beef! lowkey very jealous hehe sounds banging
01/01/2025, 19:04 - Vita: absolutely! was so lovely having you over as always:) and glad you saw at least one ray of sunlight this afternoon ;)
01/01/2025, 19:05 - Vita: starting this because I love the sentiment so much hahahaha
01/01/2025, 19:05 - Vita: sucking and fucking to enlightenment 💆‍♀️
01/01/2025, 19:05 - Vita: but genuinely that made me smile hahaha
01/01/2025, 19:05 - Vita: i feel very much the same
01/01/2025, 19:06 - Vita: and rip re: sally rooney, hopefully the lack of paper copy wont be too much of an impediment
01/01/2025, 19:07 - Vita: looking forward to starting that milan kundera book in a bath in a bit:))
01/01/2025, 21:31 - Tim Farrelly: Hahahah love to hear it!!
01/01/2025, 21:31 - Tim Farrelly: Still does hehe
01/01/2025, 21:31 - Tim Farrelly: Waiting till I get back tonight!
01/01/2025, 21:31 - Tim Farrelly: I set up the projector for the fam, and set up Hot Fuzz for them to watch
01/01/2025, 21:32 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
01/01/2025, 21:32 - Tim Farrelly: It really is genuinely really great! I'll borrow it soon for us:)
01/01/2025, 21:32 - Tim Farrelly: I'd be tempted to get one for myself - I think I'd watch much more movies with it haha
01/01/2025, 21:32 - Tim Farrelly: But shall just borrow for now!
01/01/2025, 23:04 - Vita: ahhh very good:) are you planning to head home and do some work instead of staying out in sutton so?
01/01/2025, 23:04 - Vita: :)
01/01/2025, 23:04 - Vita: hehe
01/01/2025, 23:05 - Vita: I cannot emphasise how much of an absolute vibe this looks omg
01/01/2025, 23:06 - Vita: aw that’d be lovely:,) I’ll bring some popcorn and snacks (… minstrels?!) for a movie night whenever you get a chance to borrow it
01/01/2025, 23:07 - Vita: yeah see how much you like it! and besides with the new job should you really want to get one for yourself it wouldnt break the bank hehe
01/01/2025, 23:08 - Vita: i’m just finished watching a movie with my parents, we watched an italian surrealist movie called teorema and it was so out of pocket hahaha
01/01/2025, 23:10 - Vita: apparently it was given an award at the venice film festival by the catholic church in 1968, but then they stripped it of the award following criticism from the pope. the director was then arrested for “obscenity”but later acquitted hahaha
01/01/2025, 23:10 - Vita: so that kinda gives an idea
01/01/2025, 23:15 - Tim Farrelly: The photo can't translate the vibe to be clear either!
01/01/2025, 23:15 - Tim Farrelly: Just home here reading, bout to have a smoothie, won't do any work tonight!
01/01/2025, 23:15 - Tim Farrelly: Was reading the Masters of Doom, going to read intermezzo now :)
01/01/2025, 23:16 - Tim Farrelly: Finish off my Leonidas potentially hehe
01/01/2025, 23:16 - Tim Farrelly: Yes yes and yes
01/01/2025, 23:16 - Tim Farrelly: I'll get some of those snacks too!
01/01/2025, 23:16 - Tim Farrelly: Maybe this weekend if I can get the projector
01/01/2025, 23:17 - Tim Farrelly: Exactly! Could be fun for coding visuals with
01/01/2025, 23:17 - Tim Farrelly: Hahahah sounds fun
01/01/2025, 23:20 - Vita: tbh in this case I strongly suggest you borrow it just so I can see in real life how much of a vibe it is ;)
01/01/2025, 23:21 - Vita: aww wonderful:) and v glad to hear, you’ve been insanely productive these past few nights so think you deserve the break
01/01/2025, 23:21 - Vita: lmk what you think at the end of intermezzo! I’ve been wanting to discuss it with you but didnt want to accidentally spoil anything hehe
01/01/2025, 23:22 - Vita: what should we watch?! I know we have a few we’ve been meaning to watch together but I’m totally blanking on the ones that arent in cinemas that we want to see together!
01/01/2025, 23:22 - Vita: I really need to make us a list lol
01/01/2025, 23:23 - Vita: that’d be super lovely:) maybe hugh lane and then movie? with lots of sex in between of course!
01/01/2025, 23:23 - Vita: oooh yes actually that’d be sick!
01/01/2025, 23:38 - Tim Farrelly: About to get stuck in now:)
01/01/2025, 23:38 - Tim Farrelly: Have you seen Badboy?
01/01/2025, 23:38 - Tim Farrelly: Otherwise, something Korean or similar maybe?
01/01/2025, 23:39 - Tim Farrelly: Oldboy* lmao
01/01/2025, 23:39 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
01/01/2025, 23:39 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>

01/01/2025, 23:40 - Tim Farrelly: Sounds delightful - potentially Hugh Lane the morning after though! To help us get up at a reasonable hour haha!
01/01/2025, 23:40 - Tim Farrelly: We should definitely do the cinema soon too - I guess double check when Anora is still on in cinema
02/01/2025, 00:16 - Vita: I actually just looked and can’t seem to see it - I imagine it’s no longer in theatres so we could watch that for the movie night? :) and then cinema date to the brutalist later in the month hehe
02/01/2025, 00:16 - Vita: absolutely excellent ;) I also wanna show you some jacques tati at some stage! impeccable vibes and very very lovely movies
02/01/2025, 00:17 - Vita: I havent! what’s it about? :)

02/01/2025, 03:26 - Tim Farrelly: Ah really glad you're enjoying it! It's one of my favorite novels
02/01/2025, 03:26 - Tim Farrelly: (although I can relate very little about it, it's just that kinda book)
02/01/2025, 03:26 - Tim Farrelly: (I think that was partly his goal tbh... He talks about it a bit in another novel of his I think... Although I can't remember how either hahah)
02/01/2025, 03:27 - Tim Farrelly: Finished intermezzo! Really enjoyed it as a whole
02/01/2025, 03:27 - Tim Farrelly: Also started Lee Miller's book!

02/01/2025, 12:53 - Vita: aw yay:) v v excited hehe
02/01/2025, 12:54 - Vita: no likewise - I always think that’s the hallmark of a well written book though, where you can’t relate to the protagonist but can still enjoy and appreciate it in full hehe
02/01/2025, 12:54 - Vita: it’s really really beautifully written though
02/01/2025, 12:54 - Vita: as in I’d be pausing every few pages to savor - very rare for me!
02/01/2025, 12:55 - Vita: yess we love to see it! must chat about it next time I see you I’m interested to hear your thoughts!

02/01/2025, 12:56 - Vita: HAHAHA i love
02/01/2025, 12:57 - Vita: this seems to be the opposite argument to those put forward in ornament and crime - and I love to see it (still need to read that, actually!)
02/01/2025, 12:57 - Vita: anyway just about to have some food here, then have a full day of chores and errands I’ve been putting off all christmas hehe, plus gym at some stage:)
02/01/2025, 12:58 - Vita: hope you’re able to get up and enjoy the sun today, it’s stunning out!!

02/01/2025, 14:33 - Tim Farrelly: He was in at the GP, unsurprisingly, with it on Monday😅
02/01/2025, 14:34 - Tim Farrelly: Anyways yeah made it up and out in time!
02/01/2025, 14:34 - Tim Farrelly: Was gonna head to swords but just gonna do a call with Omar instead
02/01/2025, 14:35 - Tim Farrelly: Will do! Enjoying it so far:)
02/01/2025, 14:37 - Tim Farrelly: He's honestly one of the funniest writers I know - but always makes things so clear
02/01/2025, 14:37 - Tim Farrelly: What's ornament and cunes argument?
02/01/2025, 14:38 - Tim Farrelly: Scott actually gives an overview of the different args
02/01/2025, 14:38 - Tim Farrelly: https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/friendly-and-hostile-analogies-for?utm_campaign=posts-open-in-app&triedRedirect=true

02/01/2025, 17:01 - Vita: just that any ornament is BAD and UGLY and LOW BROW and anything the public likes is wank
02/01/2025, 17:01 - Vita: and that brutalism is the way forward 😎
02/01/2025, 17:01 - Vita: so the argument is basically 
concrete = 💯🙌🤩😎😍😮‍💨
02/01/2025, 17:02 - Vita: which is real but the take as a whole is quite snobbish lol
02/01/2025, 17:02 - Vita: !!!!
02/01/2025, 17:02 - Vita: cannot waittt to smell this when I see you next:)
02/01/2025, 17:13 - Vita: amazing, will do that now!

02/01/2025, 17:33 - Tim Farrelly: just texting quickly, might also book the airbnb later! 

This one with the penthouse sold out: https://www.airbnb.ie/rooms/21017225?adults=2&children=0&infants=0&pets=0&wishlist_item_id=11004328511023&check_in=2025-01-18&check_out=2025-01-21&source_impression_id=p3_1735839151_P3CqiggmfPp-_vjL&previous_page_section_name=1000

But I think we're good to go with this one: 
https://www.airbnb.ie/rooms/2486462?check_in=2025-01-18&check_out=2025-01-21&guests=1&adults=2&s=67&unique_share_id=43301586-4580-46a7-bce5-d1237b79972b&source_impression_id=p3_1735839036_P3J7ZqT304nfU-Yp
02/01/2025, 17:34 - Tim Farrelly: I'll be able to book them later! Would be about 150ish - are you liquid enough for that, absolutely no worries if not! Can pay another time
02/01/2025, 17:34 - Tim Farrelly: back in a bit - bout to call omar
02/01/2025, 17:35 - Vita: here are a few options for the trains to valencia:) tbh theyre all fairly reasonable in price/around the same, aside from the one at 6:45 which is a tiny bit more expensive but is at a nice time for getting to explore madrid but not end up in valencia super late. tbh I’m happy with whatever but just lmk what your thoughts are!
02/01/2025, 17:35 - Vita: and yeah should be!
02/01/2025, 17:35 - Vita: no worries at all:)
02/01/2025, 17:36 - Vita: I’m so happy to go with that, pity the penthouse got sold out; a scenic fuck couldve been nice;)
02/01/2025, 17:36 - Vita: but still the place looks unreal so more than happy to go for that!
02/01/2025, 18:05 - Tim Farrelly: the gambling money came in hehe💸💲🤑
02/01/2025, 18:06 - Tim Farrelly: shall get that airbnb now anyways, just to lock it in, but there's free cancellation till the 13th so we can still have a look to see if there's anywhere else nice looking!
02/01/2025, 18:06 - Tim Farrelly: (to be clear, this is a joke hahaha)
02/01/2025, 18:06 - Tim Farrelly: text more later! And thanks for sending that
02/01/2025, 18:07 - Tim Farrelly: will have a think on this later!

02/01/2025, 18:10 - Tim Farrelly: (the 6.45 probably suits nicely! But text later!)
02/01/2025, 18:11 - Tim Farrelly: but also fyi, the thyseen and the el prado are open till 7pm and 8pm respectfully on Saturday too if we did want to get a full day in in madrid, there's still stuff open after 5 or 6!
02/01/2025, 18:11 - Tim Farrelly: so im easy
02/01/2025, 18:14 - Tim Farrelly: its not too clear to me if the airbnb is self check in or not, but from the comments, the host seems chill about check in, so arriving later won't be a bother I don't think
02/01/2025, 18:17 - Tim Farrelly: just messaged her there about checking in late anyways - what's your email for airbnb, I think I can invite you so you can see messages too, etc.
02/01/2025, 18:19 - Tim Farrelly: This is not in the centre/ old town, but private terrace alert!

02/01/2025, 21:43 - Vita: omg
02/01/2025, 21:43 - Vita: okay no but i have beef with them over that
02/01/2025, 21:43 - Vita: because we paid them a fat cleaning fee and tidied the entire place, stripped the beds and that was what we got i was RAGINGG
02/01/2025, 21:44 - Vita: so fair! besides you were on the mend for a bit so probs best to leave it to get back into it til you’re fully ready:)
02/01/2025, 21:45 - Vita: aw excellent, love to see it! I wanna read that scott alexander article you sent me at some point tonight if I get a chance:,)
02/01/2025, 21:46 - Vita: aw me too:) have a feeling you’ll be a good travel buddy ;)
02/01/2025, 21:47 - Vita: I’d be free tomorrow evening or saturday night! so whichever of those suits - my parents are having people in to dinner tomorrow but I’ll be free whenever after like 8:30!
02/01/2025, 22:10 - Tim Farrelly: hahahahaha actually I remember you mentioning this - they don't sound very nice
02/01/2025, 22:10 - Tim Farrelly: tmrw should suit well!
02/01/2025, 22:11 - Tim Farrelly: I'm adding some food things to the Notion for Valencia!

we should go to this place one of the days, for dinner or lunch. It's cheaper than Google maps says

https://maps.app.goo.gl/fh6k4QCr3tNXCzkX9
02/01/2025, 22:13 - Tim Farrelly: (just asking ChatGPT for anywhere particularly good!)
02/01/2025, 22:18 - Vita: <Media omitted>
02/01/2025, 22:19 - Vita: booking dot com keeps edging me with insane (and spenny) rentals in random places lmao
02/01/2025, 22:19 - Tim Farrelly: that room is so absurd hahahaha
02/01/2025, 22:19 - Tim Farrelly: bare it looks absolutely beautiful
02/01/2025, 22:19 - Vita: its my own fault i keep clicking on them because there are some architectural oddities out there hahaha
02/01/2025, 22:19 - Tim Farrelly: but if you were to just have the couch, tv and chairs, its very bachelor pad/ tim-esque hahaha
02/01/2025, 22:19 - Vita: no fr the furniture de-yassified it completely :,(
02/01/2025, 22:20 - Vita: they should just give it to me i’d treat it right🤩🤩
02/01/2025, 22:20 - Tim Farrelly: (busy tim/ not prioritising style tim)
02/01/2025, 22:20 - Tim Farrelly: ahh so fair
02/01/2025, 22:20 - Vita: but yeah just thought that space was particularly lovely (minus the furniture hahaha)
02/01/2025, 22:22 - Vita: oooh absolutely, the food and vibe look unreal :)
02/01/2025, 22:22 - Vita: I’m v much in!
02/01/2025, 22:22 - Tim Farrelly: it is!
02/01/2025, 22:22 - Vita: thank you chatgpt very cool;)
02/01/2025, 22:22 - Tim Farrelly: marvellous
02/01/2025, 22:23 - Vita: gonna make the bad decision of lurking on the menu now hahaha
02/01/2025, 22:24 - Vita: the chandelier inside that restaurant is fucking insane btw
02/01/2025, 22:24 - Vita: I have a few bits in our notion about food in Madrid / maybeee valencia (not sure how much research i added in on the notion for valencia but have a bunch starred on googly maps:) we should have a look together tmw!)
02/01/2025, 22:24 - Vita: this is perfect actually
02/01/2025, 22:25 - Tim Farrelly: yeah can have a look tmrw!
02/01/2025, 22:25 - Tim Farrelly: (I just enjoy doing research when travelling btw! Its a go to procrastination mode haha... gonna instead procrastinate from FOV work by doing some thesis work now though haha)
02/01/2025, 22:26 - Tim Farrelly: one last one... not sure what to make of this, but there's a Nepalese / Indian restaurant with maid cafe level reviews...

https://maps.app.goo.gl/WunMHVofBJxN7iFX7
02/01/2025, 22:28 - Vita: (I’m the same! my go-to is to do it when i’m falling asleep and then look at restaurants, enter a cycle of glutton fantasies and then finally get to sleep at an unreasonable hour hahahah)
02/01/2025, 22:28 - Vita: ((but glad to hear your procrastination is productive;)))
02/01/2025, 22:28 - Vita: (((at least for our ends of eating well if nothing else hahaha)))
02/01/2025, 22:30 - Vita: you piqued my interest with maid-cafe level reviews👀
02/01/2025, 22:31 - Vita: I come from a time honoured tradition of nearly always ending up at an indian restaurant when abroad (lowkey brussels might be the only place i havent in a really long time)
02/01/2025, 22:31 - Vita: so I would absolutely try that hahaha
02/01/2025, 22:31 - Vita: also curious about the nepalese dumplings, i’ve never had them!
02/01/2025, 22:39 - Tim Farrelly: Fantastic! We'll make it happen if it works out
02/01/2025, 22:39 - Tim Farrelly: (back to thesis work!)
02/01/2025, 23:40 - Vita: wonderful:) hope its going well hehe
02/01/2025, 23:41 - Vita: have a feeling we’ll be eating good this trip ;)

03/01/2025, 02:00 - Tim Farrelly: My thesis!
03/01/2025, 02:01 - Tim Farrelly: I'm moving back to FOV work now - but I think I'll try finish my thesis as much as I can this month
03/01/2025, 02:01 - Tim Farrelly: And just be up front with my supervisor about it (i.e. put in extra work now, to take it chill the rest of the year)
03/01/2025, 05:37 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
03/01/2025, 05:37 - Tim Farrelly: What women really want
03/01/2025, 05:38 - Tim Farrelly: Hahaha anyways I'm turning off now, productive night mixed with some scrolling, I need to set up time limits on apps more permanently haha, goodnight xx
03/01/2025, 10:14 - Vita: gm I’m awak
03/01/2025, 10:16 - Vita: of course! looking amazing if I dare say so:) I’d say your supervisor will understand in any case about your decision re: workload distribution
03/01/2025, 10:16 - Vita: hahahaha
03/01/2025, 10:16 - Vita: its very much giving “are you fucking coming out or wha’”
03/01/2025, 10:18 - Vita: good morning though:) heading out to meet a friend for a walk and coffee, then yoga with my mum again for her teacher training thing hehe
03/01/2025, 10:19 - Vita: hope you’re getting a great sleep in :,)
03/01/2025, 10:19 - Vita: stayed up a tinyy bit late reading in the end - got to the bit where Tereza is like “please stop cheating on me” and Tomas was like “no ❤️ I organised for you to be shot!” and couldnt tear my eyes away hahahah
03/01/2025, 10:20 - Vita: it’s so good though I’m already over halfway through
03/01/2025, 10:22 - Vita: <Media omitted>
03/01/2025, 10:23 - Vita: thought this was really excellent, need to start notating/taking more photos of passages I really enjoy
03/01/2025, 11:29 - Vita: also just realised our first date was 4 months ago today:,)
03/01/2025, 14:19 - Tim Farrelly: Text in a bit! Just out of FOV meeting, calling Omar
03/01/2025, 15:23 - Tim Farrelly: Hello!
03/01/2025, 15:23 - Tim Farrelly: Out doing a shop rn!
03/01/2025, 15:24 - Tim Farrelly: Stopped by rituals so smell amazing hehe
03/01/2025, 15:25 - Tim Farrelly: Text you fully later, but do you think it'd be ok to have our movie night tmrw? I feel like I have a lot of work I'd still like to get done today, and potentially slightly time conscious as we need to order cameras asap. If tmrw doesn't work though, tonight is still good for me! Just a preference for tmrw
03/01/2025, 15:25 - Tim Farrelly: It's beautiful out!
03/01/2025, 15:28 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
03/01/2025, 15:28 - Tim Farrelly: Hahahahaha
03/01/2025, 15:29 - Tim Farrelly: 🫦
03/01/2025, 15:29 - Tim Farrelly: Precisely
03/01/2025, 15:29 - Tim Farrelly: Or wha
03/01/2025, 15:29 - Tim Farrelly: Ah sounds very lovely
03/01/2025, 15:32 - Vita: reply properly later but I kinda organised my weekend around doing tonight so would much prefer that. I can come over later or something just I organised to meet my childhood best friend sunday morning and really wouldnt want to be late or jeopardise it because it’ll be awhile before I’d get to see her with how our schedules are aligning
03/01/2025, 15:32 - Vita: (she’s on nights next week and then going away between her week off after nights and then has annual leave which she’s going on holidays for so realistically with my college schedule vs her intern schedule it’d be another month or so before I could see her)
03/01/2025, 15:33 - Vita: I’d offered her to meet sunday evening when I thought we might be doing tmw but she starts work at 8pm so that wouldnt really work
03/01/2025, 15:36 - Vita: but yeah hope that works! like I said can come over for 9:30 or 10 if it’s better!
03/01/2025, 16:21 - Tim Farrelly: ah yeah lets do tonight then!
03/01/2025, 16:21 - Tim Farrelly: 10 would suit well if that sounds good!
03/01/2025, 16:21 - Tim Farrelly: Minstrels have been acquired anyways
03/01/2025, 16:22 - Tim Farrelly: and I've dropped my phone in for battery replacement!
03/01/2025, 16:22 - Tim Farrelly: I held off getting popcorn as I was going to pop into M and S otw back for a special type of popcorn they have in M and S in England, but they don't seem to have it here!
03/01/2025, 16:22 - Tim Farrelly: If you could bring a microwave packet, that'd be ideal!
03/01/2025, 16:24 - Vita: just texting quickly but out in the shops atm, anything you want me to acquire for tn aside from microwave popcorn? hehe
03/01/2025, 16:25 - Vita: thanks! sorry about that!
03/01/2025, 16:30 - Tim Farrelly: nothing comes to mind! thanks
03/01/2025, 16:30 - Tim Farrelly: got fresh orange juice for us tmrw morning anwyays too
03/01/2025, 16:42 - Vita: nw, I picked us up some chilli dark chocolate because I hadnt seen it in awhile and wanted to try it hehe

03/01/2025, 16:46 - Vita: I’ll keep doing this so
03/01/2025, 16:46 - Vita: no more kisses with goodnight texts - just ‘i sleepa now’
03/01/2025, 16:49 - Vita: oh also! should I book the 6:45 train to valencia or do you wanna chat more about it later/book it later? :)

03/01/2025, 19:02 - Tim Farrelly: Ah Ive had the real ones! Would still be a treat tho
03/01/2025, 19:02 - Tim Farrelly: Also, perhaps mamas revenge tmrw...?
03/01/2025, 19:11 - Vita: yess sounds good! we can have a look at everything:)
03/01/2025, 19:11 - Vita: just up from an absolutely insane nap

05/01/2025, 19:49 - Vita: might do some stretches after a bath just to warm up the body a bit:)
05/01/2025, 19:50 - Vita: yeah thats the thing, seems the more decent ones are often quite busy:( the practise I was with in malahide had a good gp (not the main one, but one of the other doctors in the practise was brilliant) but it might be a bit out of the ways for ye
05/01/2025, 19:50 - Vita: my parents have people in so I had a drink with them, tidied up my room, and then spent way too long fiddling with the journal app aella used to track her stats for the year hahaha
05/01/2025, 19:51 - Vita: it’s super neat though, shout out to her for posting about it, I might *actually* use this thing since I really like the interface
05/01/2025, 19:51 - Vita: then otherwise gonna start the book you very kindly lent me:)
05/01/2025, 19:52 - Vita: and have dinner in a bit!

05/01/2025, 20:23 - Vita: this is the doctor I really liked, also could be good for your parents because he has a diploma in rheumatology would have that bit of extra knowledge for managing their arthritis
05/01/2025, 20:23 - Vita: he’s lovely and very knowledgeable
05/01/2025, 20:23 - Vita: I had a look as well and they are accepting new patients atm! so could be handy if they can’t get in with any of the ones natasha recommended
05/01/2025, 20:24 - Vita: it’s called daylio, I’m mostly using it to track my mood and reading, hobbies and fitness!

06/01/2025, 19:31 - Vita: literally 5 mins up the road! its actually silly convenient, I ought to do this more often
06/01/2025, 19:31 - Vita: it is indeed 🥺
06/01/2025, 19:32 - Vita: but hey once I get my license then (positive thinking here lol - willing it), then you can be my passenger princess 😌
06/01/2025, 19:33 - Vita: there’s a sauna out in portrane near tower bay, and was thinking it could be a cute date (when the weather is not literally baltic hahaha) to drive us out there, go for a swim and then pop in the sauna to warm up:)
06/01/2025, 19:36 - Tim Farrelly: Always reliable!
06/01/2025, 19:36 - Tim Farrelly: So handy!!
06/01/2025, 19:37 - Tim Farrelly: Could you need any more motivation?
06/01/2025, 19:37 - Tim Farrelly: Ooo that'd be absolutely lovely!
06/01/2025, 19:37 - Tim Farrelly: Potentially easy access to Wicklow hikes too!
06/01/2025, 19:38 - Tim Farrelly: I'd love to actually do Glendalough at some stage
06/01/2025, 19:38 - Vita: lets make this happen!
06/01/2025, 19:38 - Vita: we can even grab a bus down, oscar and hannah did that awhile ago before he got his license!
06/01/2025, 19:39 - Vita: but I absolutely *love* that hike and wanna do it with you:)
06/01/2025, 19:39 - Vita: once it gets slightly less icy/when I pass my test (the two will likely co-incide), we should get out there!!
06/01/2025, 19:40 - Vita: but also if we do it soon I will contest it’s mandatory we do it again on a hot summer day to dip in the little pools on the way down
06/01/2025, 22:03 - Vita: also would you like to spend the evening together on wed/Thurs?!
06/01/2025, 22:51 - Tim Farrelly: Yes!

06/01/2025, 23:29 - Tim Farrelly: Ah called her just there but will call back and mention, I had it on the tip of my tongue but something else came up
06/01/2025, 23:29 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
06/01/2025, 23:29 - Tim Farrelly: Oops meant to forward that to Trish haha
06/01/2025, 23:32 - Tim Farrelly: And yes, let's. Most likely Wednesday will suit me if that works for you
06/01/2025, 23:32 - Tim Farrelly: We can get too good to go potentially from sprout?
06/01/2025, 23:48 - Vita: hahahaha dw at all!
06/01/2025, 23:48 - Vita: that’s perfect for me actually:)
06/01/2025, 23:48 - Vita: and too good to go from sprout sounds ideal - really hoping they’ll have leftover guac👀👀
06/01/2025, 23:49 - Vita: what are you up to this evening, still at patch or back at trinity? :)
07/01/2025, 00:22 - Vita: okay I’d better head to bed, early morning again tmw - goodnight! xx
07/01/2025, 01:12 - Tim Farrelly: Update: would it be ok if we met up a bit later on Wednesday, and I might skip the Sprout personally, or you can get it for yourself! I think I'll get dinner with some friends (the ones I was supposed to see the movie with tonight but skipped to work) as there's a guest in town from Stripe Press
07/01/2025, 01:12 - Tim Farrelly: Dinners at 7pm so could meetup just after 8?
07/01/2025, 01:12 - Tim Farrelly: Otherwise, I'm free Thursday evening too:)
07/01/2025, 01:13 - Tim Farrelly: I haven't touched fov work yet. I'm going to try get in touch with Irish Times, etc. very soon for Hack Ireland, and asking friends for intros

07/01/2025, 03:24 - Tim Farrelly: Got some FOV work done there anyways, but was certainly quite unproductive
07/01/2025, 03:24 - Tim Farrelly: In bed now:)
07/01/2025, 03:24 - Tim Farrelly: Gonna read some Doom + Lee Miller then turn off:)
07/01/2025, 03:25 - Tim Farrelly: Probably by about 4ish. Have a meeting in dogpatch at 12.30 tmrw anyways so have to be up in time for that!
07/01/2025, 03:27 - Tim Farrelly: If you get a sprout on Wednesday, might ask you to pick me up one too hehe, so good to have in the fridge for the next day!
07/01/2025, 09:16 - Vita: good morning!
07/01/2025, 09:16 - Vita: yes this works!
07/01/2025, 09:17 - Vita: this could also potentially work for me but lets maybe stick with thursday since I might be going out with friends thursday evening!
07/01/2025, 09:19 - Vita: just at placement now respond in a bit!
07/01/2025, 09:22 - Vita: nvm hahaha the team isnt in yet

07/01/2025, 09:24 - Vita: ah nice:) love to see it! I hope you get a good sleep anyway!
07/01/2025, 09:25 - Vita: if I end up staying tomorrow, just to say I might need to fall asleep around 12 since I’ll be on plavement the next day and don’t wanna show up like a ghoul hahaha - you’re welcome to stay up working but I’ll just have to turn off then:,)
07/01/2025, 13:50 - Tim Farrelly: Ok perfect!
07/01/2025, 13:50 - Tim Farrelly: Is that the pub quiz haha?
07/01/2025, 13:52 - Tim Farrelly: Honestly main thing is just seeing my friends. But she has a cool job, she works for stripe press (stripe has a publishing company , generally focused around science and progress) and works in progress (the small progress book on my shelf)

07/01/2025, 13:55 - Tim Farrelly: Oh yeah no ofc, totally get it, I might _try_ to fall asleep with you then! As unfortunately have a 9.30 meeting tmrw, I might be tired enough for that hahaha
07/01/2025, 14:29 - Vita: it is indeed! (potentially) hehe
07/01/2025, 14:29 - Vita: hopefully it happens bc a few are going skiing from saturday so will miss them :,)

07/01/2025, 16:08 - Tim Farrelly: Thank you and same here:)
07/01/2025, 16:08 - Tim Farrelly: One of your many talents;)
07/01/2025, 16:09 - Tim Farrelly: What's the difference between detox and rehab? Detox is further along with treatment?
07/01/2025, 16:09 - Tim Farrelly: He had a cold! So won't see him till Btys
07/01/2025, 16:09 - Tim Farrelly: So I slept in more as a result hahah, only got out of bed at 2
07/01/2025, 16:09 - Tim Farrelly: Still, better than it was last week I guess haha!
07/01/2025, 16:10 - Tim Farrelly: I actually went on a nice walk there and popped into the NGI, they have a good few new pieces up!
07/01/2025, 16:10 - Tim Farrelly: But no, just working otherwise, going to try out together a press release for hack Ireland and get into some Irish papers

07/01/2025, 17:23 - Tim Farrelly: But again, what!!!???
07/01/2025, 17:23 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
07/01/2025, 17:23 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>

07/01/2025, 17:23 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
07/01/2025, 17:23 - Tim Farrelly: New paintings!
07/01/2025, 17:25 - Tim Farrelly: Very clear! Thanks for sending this
07/01/2025, 17:25 - Tim Farrelly: Have you looked much into the research on psychedelics for addiction? I'm sure you'll find it super interesting if not
07/01/2025, 18:17 - Vita: the harry clarke is beautiful oh my god
07/01/2025, 18:17 - Vita: glad they got the goose girl one out again!
07/01/2025, 18:17 - Vita: yeah FR!!!
07/01/2025, 18:17 - Vita: hehe nw z
07/01/2025, 18:17 - Vita: *x oops
07/01/2025, 18:17 - Vita: was jaywalking while typing🫣
07/01/2025, 18:18 - Vita: yes omg it’s fascinating!
07/01/2025, 18:18 - Vita: we’re way too catholic guilt ridden as a country to implement but i remain optimistic that further research will speak for itself
07/01/2025, 20:11 - Tim Farrelly: Ah I hadn't seen that before!!
07/01/2025, 20:11 - Tim Farrelly: There was another by the same painter too
07/01/2025, 20:12 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah there's a point at which it becomes deeply immoral to not adopt new research and tech
07/01/2025, 20:13 - Tim Farrelly: And economically disadvantageous
07/01/2025, 20:13 - Tim Farrelly: Just back from the run, gonna have a quick microwave meal, then get stuck into work
07/01/2025, 20:13 - Tim Farrelly: Up early so going to set an alarm for 12.30, at which point, I'll stop work and do some reading:)
07/01/2025, 21:00 - Vita: just at the pub quiz now! hehe
07/01/2025, 21:00 - Vita: I must pop by soon to see!
07/01/2025, 21:01 - Vita: I’d be curious to see what level the irish healthcare system goes to with this though, there’s quite a lot of controversy about it in the field
07/01/2025, 21:01 - Vita: hope its going well! do pop over if you get bored ;)
07/01/2025, 21:02 - Vita: oooh very very nice, you’ll be back on track in no time :)
07/01/2025, 21:02 - Vita: plus this and tomorrow! very normal hours of sleep!
07/01/2025, 21:39 - Tim Farrelly: ah good luck!
07/01/2025, 21:39 - Tim Farrelly: oh really!! Is there other examples of tried and tested stuff we're not adopting?
07/01/2025, 21:40 - Tim Farrelly: (understand psychedelics are still quite in the early days (or the 2nd set of "early days" of research)
07/01/2025, 22:34 - Vita: we got 10/10 on the last round🥳
07/01/2025, 22:36 - Vita: reply properly later but more so that they refuse to do further trials / the field is slowed down by resistors high up
07/01/2025, 22:38 - Vita: yes they are! tbf the main research wouldnt happen here either way but it’s a big pity. if I do decide to do psych I’ll probs try practise in the UK for a year or two later in my training to try do a bit of research in this since it’s more likely to happen somewhere there like in one of the big colleges down south/in london:)
07/01/2025, 22:42 - Vita: i say this specifically because one of the reg’s was telling me today that usually people do the exams for the UK during their basic training here which makes it super super easy to practise there too hehe
07/01/2025, 22:42 - Vita: (which is kinda baller bc i thought i’d have to stay here for the entire scheme which wouldnt be the worst but nice to have the option!)
07/01/2025, 22:43 - Tim Farrelly: lfg!!!
07/01/2025, 22:43 - Tim Farrelly: gotcha - thats a common tragedy unfortunately
07/01/2025, 22:44 - Tim Farrelly: ah yeah UCL is doing good stuff in particular!
07/01/2025, 22:44 - Tim Farrelly: Ah thats great to hear!
07/01/2025, 22:44 - Tim Farrelly: what were the topics like?
07/01/2025, 23:48 - Vita: movie stills, history, geography, sports (🤢), and a few other miscellaneous bits!
07/01/2025, 23:48 - Vita: but omg it was *hard*
07/01/2025, 23:48 - Vita: like one of the sports questions was “who had the fastest 1600m indoor sprint in 1994 in Ireland” HAHAHA
07/01/2025, 23:49 - Vita: just walking home now! better get to bed asappp to be in tomorrow:) but not in til 9:30 so shouldnt be too bad!
07/01/2025, 23:49 - Vita: hows the work going? :)
07/01/2025, 23:49 - Vita: not to state the obvious but its so fucking cold omg
07/01/2025, 23:49 - Vita: they had fires going in the pub which was beyond lovely:,)
07/01/2025, 23:49 - Vita: and we won some free drinks🥳
08/01/2025, 00:15 - Vita: home safe:)
08/01/2025, 00:26 - Tim Farrelly: Oh my god, did someone get that without cheating hahahah?
08/01/2025, 00:27 - Tim Farrelly: Will likely be working till 1:/ Not amazing as just realized I need a new cable for a component which was very unclear, and missed the amazon timeframe for delivery by Thursday by 5 mins:')
08/01/2025, 00:27 - Tim Farrelly: But ah sure
08/01/2025, 00:27 - Tim Farrelly: Getting plenty done now:)
08/01/2025, 00:27 - Tim Farrelly: Freezing hahah
08/01/2025, 00:27 - Tim Farrelly: The Daphne is doing well nonetheless

08/01/2025, 01:12 - Tim Farrelly: also, I know this is early, but when would it suit to meetup next btw?
08/01/2025, 01:12 - Tim Farrelly: I'm just going to turn off my laptop now! Going to put down some TODOs on what I need to work on for tmrw/ next few days
08/01/2025, 01:15 - Tim Farrelly: I'm in London on Saturday... I'll be waking for that at 7am or so... welcome to come over on Friday evening and we can do something if you're ok with me leaving early in the morning. You can sleep in of course!!
08/01/2025, 01:15 - Tim Farrelly: Otherwise, can sleep over late on Saturday (I won't be back till 12), and we can do something on Sunady during the day
08/01/2025, 01:16 - Tim Farrelly: (I'm going to do the stained glass course you got me, thanks again, thats so thoughtful, one of these sunday afternoons!)
08/01/2025, 01:16 - Tim Farrelly: anyways, might as well say good night now, look forward to seeing you tmrw:)
08/01/2025, 09:15 - Vita: mmmmm i suspect they were cheating bc they got ten on that round and not everyone doing the pub quiz is visible to the quizmaster….
08/01/2025, 09:15 - Tim Farrelly: Hello☠️
08/01/2025, 09:15 - Tim Farrelly: Good morning lol

08/01/2025, 13:20 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
08/01/2025, 13:20 - Tim Farrelly: It was one of these types of things, and I lost my position when I went for caffeine tablets, and now sold out:')
08/01/2025, 13:20 - Tim Farrelly: Not a great system
08/01/2025, 13:20 - Tim Farrelly: Were only released this morning
08/01/2025, 13:20 - Tim Farrelly: !
08/01/2025, 13:20 - Tim Farrelly: higher demand than they expected I'd say
08/01/2025, 13:21 - Vita: awww nooo that’s such a pity:(
08/01/2025, 13:21 - Vita: the rise of strava has devastated their operating systems lmao
08/01/2025, 13:22 - Vita: glad you’ve secured the caffeine tablets though, I feel they will be invaluable over the next few days
08/01/2025, 13:22 - Vita: how are the energy levels atm?!
08/01/2025, 14:53 - Vita: didnt get to see the guy with sex addiction:(( but was given an anonymised version of his notes to look at later!
08/01/2025, 15:23 - Tim Farrelly: Hahahah exa
08/01/2025, 15:23 - Tim Farrelly: Exactly
08/01/2025, 15:23 - Tim Farrelly: Or more so that they just didn't implement auto scaling
08/01/2025, 15:23 - Tim Farrelly: Tired but not too bad! Able to work fine
08/01/2025, 15:24 - Tim Farrelly: Nawww, ah sure hope it's juicy
08/01/2025, 15:24 - Tim Farrelly: Hahaha
08/01/2025, 15:24 - Tim Farrelly: Reminder: I might need to spend 20 mins doing some planning this evening
08/01/2025, 15:24 - Tim Farrelly: Need to leave for dogpatch soon to meet with Omar but I need to do some planning for a meeting with dogpatch tmrw for hack Ireland
08/01/2025, 16:08 - Vita: just home now! gonna take a 15 min nap then hit the gym and do a bit of work:)
08/01/2025, 16:08 - Vita: love to see it!
08/01/2025, 16:10 - Vita: hahahah it is, quite - though somewhat milder than I wouldve thought - he was managing to remain abstinent for up to 6 weeks from porn/masturbation but would then relapse and be seeking extramartial affairs so really quite sad :(
08/01/2025, 16:11 - Vita: (he has since been divorced by his wife - weirdly he specifically mentions targeting women from sri lanka/the phillipines for his affairs, because they’re “easier to get around” (in his words), not sure what exactly that means though)
08/01/2025, 16:12 - Vita: ooh for london?
08/01/2025, 16:13 - Vita: oooh hope its all going well!
08/01/2025, 16:16 - Vita: i’ll tell you more about it later bc its a really really interesting case, not sure how suitable he is for a rehab programme though because he’s very much unable to exist around women without florid sexual fantasies when he’s in a bad way
08/01/2025, 16:17 - Tim Farrelly: Ah the poor guy
08/01/2025, 16:18 - Tim Farrelly: Ah no for dogpatch labs meeting tmrw morning!
08/01/2025, 16:18 - Tim Farrelly: Would be interested to hear what qualifies someone for rehab vs not
08/01/2025, 16:19 - Vita: yeah its really sad
08/01/2025, 16:19 - Vita: can have a chat about it later! but mostly varies consultant to consultant/programme to programme!
08/01/2025, 16:19 - Vita: even sadder case with a 19 year old I’ll tell you about later, *really* hoping things make a move in the right direction for him asap
08/01/2025, 17:56 - Vita: wait actually what time for tonight again did you say? was it like 8:30? :)
08/01/2025, 18:01 - Tim Farrelly: I'm having dinner at Kathmandu at 7, so should be finished by about 8:)
08/01/2025, 18:02 - Tim Farrelly: You're welcome to arrive whenever and let yourself in if you'd like
08/01/2025, 18:02 - Tim Farrelly: but 8.30 sounds good otherwise

08/01/2025, 19:50 - Tim Farrelly: Dinners moving slow, I'll be back at 8.30 I'd say
08/01/2025, 19:55 - Vita: no worries! I’ll probs get there just before you since im leaving now!
08/01/2025, 20:13 - Tim Farrelly: Still here, I'll leave in 10 mins in case people are still chatting!
08/01/2025, 20:18 - Vita: nw! I’m at yours now, soon to be naked ;)
08/01/2025, 20:30 - Tim Farrelly: Didn't realize time, will be heading now in a couple mins!!

09/01/2025, 13:36 - Vita: nobody new, though the sex addict guy got admitted, and the 19 year old *might* stay for rehab which would be unreal even just for the sake of getting away from his family for a bit
09/01/2025, 13:36 - Vita: seems there’ll be a couple new admissions tmw though, the current gang is doing well otherwise!
09/01/2025, 13:37 - Vita: HAHAHAHHA

09/01/2025, 18:06 - Vita: hehe sounds like you’ve got a great weekend coming up in any case :,)
09/01/2025, 18:06 - Vita: i’m currently tryna organize mine, unfortunately will need to go to the library or at least get quite a lot of work done one of the days :,(
09/01/2025, 18:33 - Tim Farrelly: Yep we won't be able to sit together, but there's still tickets available for tmrw, shall I get you on?
09/01/2025, 18:34 - Tim Farrelly: Should be a good one!
09/01/2025, 18:34 - Tim Farrelly: Ah lovely, I'm quite tired surprisingly despite the sleep, I guess it was a bit broken at the end, I think I'll head out for a run now to wake myself up
09/01/2025, 18:34 - Tim Farrelly: Otherwise, it'd be a gym session, but feel too tired for that tbh
09/01/2025, 18:35 - Tim Farrelly: Feels like it's a bit late to take a caffeine tablet hahah, the run should do the job!
09/01/2025, 18:49 - Tim Farrelly: its tmrw at 8!
09/01/2025, 18:49 - Tim Farrelly: in the theatre pavilion in dun laoghrie
09/01/2025, 18:53 - Vita: that’d be amazing! lmk how much it is and i’ll rev ya:)
09/01/2025, 18:53 - Vita: wonderful!
09/01/2025, 18:53 - Vita: that suits perfectly
09/01/2025, 18:54 - Vita: though if I’m imposing on you and your friends I’m also quite happy to just meet you later or figure out a workaround on sunday!
09/01/2025, 18:54 - Vita: i’d say thats defo a wise choice!
09/01/2025, 18:55 - Vita: yeah i’d limit caffeine use past 12pm/1pm just for sleep hygeine, it has a super long half life
09/01/2025, 19:39 - Tim Farrelly: sweet! just asked Sam where our seats are so will find something nearby, its 17 if that's ok!
09/01/2025, 19:40 - Tim Farrelly: ah no not at all!
09/01/2025, 19:40 - Tim Farrelly: no run yet! But I'll definitely get out for another walk to get the step count up
09/01/2025, 20:02 - Tim Farrelly: ok booked you m2 and we're in m6-m9, so might be able to ask m3-m5 to move down one!
09/01/2025, 20:02 - Tim Farrelly: so that worked out nicely
09/01/2025, 20:02 - Tim Farrelly: its practically booked out
09/01/2025, 20:05 - Vita: sent there!
09/01/2025, 20:05 - Vita: ah excellent!
09/01/2025, 20:05 - Vita: i’ll bring the minstrels ;) look forward to it!
09/01/2025, 20:06 - Vita: even better if m3-m5 doesnt move its more minstrels for me xxx
09/01/2025, 20:06 - Vita: (joking ofc……… haha unless….)
09/01/2025, 20:22 - Tim Farrelly: hahaha ok great!
09/01/2025, 20:23 - Tim Farrelly: its a great movie - I saw it before and it was fantastic, but its "AI generated", in a sense, they have a pool of lots of clips, and these get pulled from semi-randomly so ill probably see a good bit I didn't see before!
09/01/2025, 20:23 - Tim Farrelly: just forwarded you the email (ps there was a booking charge of 1 euro which doesn't show on the email fyi hahahah
09/01/2025, 20:24 - Tim Farrelly: oh wait yeah no it does, just not in the total
09/01/2025, 20:25 - Tim Farrelly: Does it suit to meet on the dart out to dun laoghrie?
09/01/2025, 20:56 - Vita: oooh thats actually a really interesting way to do it! even more curious to see it now:,)
09/01/2025, 20:57 - Vita: not you making a profit😩😩😩
09/01/2025, 20:57 - Vita: if you want a sugar daddy you can just ask, tim ;)

09/01/2025, 21:26 - Tim Farrelly: yeah its really quite innovative!
09/01/2025, 21:26 - Tim Farrelly: oh he's the guy who made those glow up 30k vinyl players I think!!!!
09/01/2025, 21:26 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>

09/01/2025, 21:27 - Tim Farrelly: Ok perfect!
09/01/2025, 21:27 - Tim Farrelly: I'm having some issues with fov tech, will set an alarm for 1am anyways to stop working by then. and should get out for a walk before then hopefully. If I get the fov stuff working soon, hopefully will write a press release draft for hack ireland

10/01/2025, 03:37 - Tim Farrelly: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wxGb-qCe7TEFcildpBQE7gqZznakOt-ZzvNJHo0_jq4/edit?usp=sharing

stayed up late writing this - definitely less productive than I would have been normally, but just wanted to get it done lol
10/01/2025, 03:37 - Tim Farrelly: took 2 hours I think for that lmao
10/01/2025, 03:37 - Tim Farrelly: but draft 1 done now!
10/01/2025, 03:37 - Tim Farrelly: goodnight - looking forward to tmrw too!
10/01/2025, 09:38 - Vita: unreal!
10/01/2025, 09:38 - Vita: i cant help but giggle seeing the quotes from yourself (knowing that you wrote the article hehe)
10/01/2025, 09:39 - Vita: im just on my way in now - late as ever but ho hum no meetings this morning
10/01/2025, 09:39 - Vita: hopefully some new admissions🤪

10/01/2025, 13:00 - Tim Farrelly: Took me quite a while to get to sleep I think. I need to make a habit of reading before bed, even when super tired/ it's really late. It definitely helps me "turn off"
10/01/2025, 13:05 - Vita: cortisol levels drop by ~40% after 20 mins of reading so this is scientifically accurate hahaha
10/01/2025, 13:05 - Vita: hey you’re almost back on your old schedule!!!
10/01/2025, 13:05 - Vita: almost hehe
10/01/2025, 13:05 - Vita: busy busy today, lots of new admissions

10/01/2025, 19:06 - Tim Farrelly: Considered deleting this, as it's really great place, but it's true hahaha
10/01/2025, 19:06 - Tim Farrelly: Hehe;)

13/01/2025, 22:30 - Tim Farrelly: The next train to Malahide was delayed (meeting my mom at howth junction, she's very kindly driving out)
13/01/2025, 22:31 - Tim Farrelly: And I didn't shut down my laptop while I was in the gym. Just turned it off. And now it's out of charge:')
13/01/2025, 22:31 - Tim Farrelly: Literally has a battery life of 1 hour whether or not you're using it hahaha
13/01/2025, 22:31 - Tim Farrelly: So missing quite a bit of work time, but ah sure

14/01/2025, 20:05 - Vita: aesthetic shock therapy yes
14/01/2025, 20:06 - Tim Farrelly: Unless you're starving, it might suit me well to get another 10 mins in the gym and then head straight to sprout for us! If you want to go home and get ready so we can eat together 


... As I was typing that out, realized washing your hair could take a while!
14/01/2025, 20:06 - Tim Farrelly: Will I meet you now in 10, we can eat together, then you head home? I assume hair wash might take a bit!
14/01/2025, 20:07 - Tim Farrelly: I'm finishing up here anyways really
14/01/2025, 20:07 - Vita: yeah the quickest that’d be would be about 30-45 mins hahaha

14/01/2025, 20:07 - Tim Farrelly: Oh to be a man;)

15/01/2025, 22:06 - Tim Farrelly: of course!
15/01/2025, 22:06 - Tim Farrelly: Just working! FOV work was a bit frustrating but got things 90% working there at the end. Doing some Patch work right now, but think I'll get out for a quick walk in 25 mins or so
15/01/2025, 22:07 - Tim Farrelly: I'll send photos of my run when im at my phone!

15/01/2025, 22:09 - Tim Farrelly: have you seen any designs lately that have caught your eyes?
15/01/2025, 22:28 - Vita: <Media omitted>
15/01/2025, 22:29 - Vita: hahaha not you marking this👀
15/01/2025, 22:29 - Vita: my dads actually lent me a pair for the time being but thank you so much for the offer again:)
15/01/2025, 22:29 - Vita: oooh good views? :)
15/01/2025, 22:30 - Vita: sounds like a plan ;)
15/01/2025, 22:30 - Vita: sure seems your sleep schedule has returned to semi normalcy so we love to see it!
15/01/2025, 22:31 - Vita: very much - I think I prefer the writing style in the unbearable lightness of being but it’s still very beautiful. I got to the bit just there where it comes out that ludvik is actually somewhat repulsed by helena but wants to sleep with her anyway, when i tell you my jaw dropped reading how pre-meditated it was hahaha
15/01/2025, 22:32 - Vita: yes! saw some chainmail earrings on my feed the other day that would be nice with the necklace i made so gonna try do something similar:)
15/01/2025, 23:49 - Vita: gonna read and turn off here, good luck with the work!! goodnight:) xxx
15/01/2025, 23:52 - Tim Farrelly: Noooo!!! That's a 2nd hand book hahahahaha
15/01/2025, 23:52 - Tim Farrelly: If there's not a little star/ asterisk at the top of the page, or little curly ends to a line on the side like that, it's not mine
15/01/2025, 23:53 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
15/01/2025, 23:53 - Tim Farrelly: Like that!!!
15/01/2025, 23:53 - Tim Farrelly: Ah fantastic!
15/01/2025, 23:53 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
15/01/2025, 23:53 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
15/01/2025, 23:54 - Tim Farrelly: I can't recall that point or those characters tbh, but I can imagine it from Kundera hahaha!
15/01/2025, 23:54 - Tim Farrelly: Very glad to hear you're enjoying:)
15/01/2025, 23:55 - Tim Farrelly: Ah fantastic!!
15/01/2025, 23:55 - Tim Farrelly: Goodnight xx
15/01/2025, 23:55 - Tim Farrelly: I was just lying down on my phone there for about 30/40 mins I think
15/01/2025, 23:55 - Tim Farrelly: Gonna go for a v quick walk rn, 15 mins or so, then aim to get to turn off by just after 1 actually I think!
16/01/2025, 02:56 - Tim Farrelly: Ah so just finished up there lol. So much for turning off at 1 lol
16/01/2025, 02:56 - Tim Farrelly: I didn't get back to work till 12.35 tho tbf
16/01/2025, 02:56 - Tim Farrelly: But ah sure!
16/01/2025, 02:57 - Tim Farrelly: The grunt FOV work is 99% out of the way now:)
16/01/2025, 08:53 - Vita: AHAHAHHA oh my god tim the previous owner had been doing you so dirty at different times
16/01/2025, 08:53 - Vita: relieving to hear haha
16/01/2025, 08:54 - Vita: but also makes so much sense because a lot of the stuff highlighted was more revealing stuff about the characters and their thoughts than being actually beautiful writing which i know is more your bag
16/01/2025, 08:55 - Vita: hahahaha i will keep this in mind in future
16/01/2025, 08:55 - Vita: awww this is such a cute pic! did you send it to the couple? :)
16/01/2025, 08:55 - Vita: also very lovely
16/01/2025, 08:56 - Vita: yes it’s great! I think I’ll need to read something uplifting next though because it gets quite dark lol
16/01/2025, 08:57 - Vita: ahhh fair enough, and probs good you got out for a walk! glad you were so productive as well it’ll take away any pressure to do too much in spain! (but again ofc if you need a bitta time in the evenings im more than happy to accommodate x)
16/01/2025, 08:57 - Vita: good morning btw!
16/01/2025, 08:57 - Vita: im just on the bus into placement, then coming home early for my driving test🥺👉👈
16/01/2025, 08:58 - Vita: slept well last night other than a really gnarly nightmare which broke up my sleep after😩

16/01/2025, 13:11 - Vita: I’m about to head up to take the driving test😖 wish me luck!
16/01/2025, 13:12 - Vita: hehe what can I say, you have good taste in writing;)
16/01/2025, 13:23 - Tim Farrelly: Ah I should have but didn't!!
16/01/2025, 13:23 - Tim Farrelly: Quite a while since I've done that
16/01/2025, 13:24 - Tim Farrelly: Aww no hahaha. Avoid Murakami anyways, or at least, Norwegian wood lol
16/01/2025, 13:24 - Tim Farrelly: I actually don't think I ever read the Joke now I think about it!
16/01/2025, 13:25 - Tim Farrelly: Ah appreciate it! Most likely won't be bringing my laptop anyways so only so much can do!
16/01/2025, 13:25 - Tim Farrelly: Ah yes! Best of bestest of luck!!
16/01/2025, 13:26 - Tim Farrelly: Just take it easy

16/01/2025, 13:55 - Tim Farrelly: https://maps.app.goo.gl/e6n3BAiXuHNSVCnv6
16/01/2025, 13:55 - Tim Farrelly: I'm procrastinating but found that place! There's a Picasso exhibition on atm! Not sure how we missed it!

https://www.visitvalencia.com/en/events-valencia/regional-dances-streets-valencia
16/01/2025, 15:31 - Vita: failed lol
16/01/2025, 15:31 - Vita: reply in a bit!
16/01/2025, 15:32 - Vita: was weird though. dont think it went particularly badly. he just was very subjective on some aspects
16/01/2025, 16:15 - Tim Farrelly: ahh sorry to hear that - but glad it probably went fine!
16/01/2025, 16:15 - Tim Farrelly: This was your first one right?
16/01/2025, 16:15 - Tim Farrelly: What did he mark you down on?
16/01/2025, 16:15 - Tim Farrelly: Did you get any reds? Or just an accumulation of yellows
16/01/2025, 16:16 - Vita: one red and a fair few yellows lol - will explain when i see you next just getting home now
16/01/2025, 16:16 - Vita: and got new headphones thank god!
16/01/2025, 16:17 - Vita: yep!
16/01/2025, 16:17 - Vita: idk im really disappointed considering literally everyone i’ve driven with was saying i’d probs pass
16/01/2025, 16:19 - Vita: but got a really really bad vibe off the guy marking me
16/01/2025, 16:19 - Vita: like from the outset i think he did not want to pass me
16/01/2025, 16:21 - Tim Farrelly: awww yeah that happens
16/01/2025, 16:21 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
16/01/2025, 16:21 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
16/01/2025, 16:22 - Vita: if anything it’s just such an inconvenience hahaha
16/01/2025, 16:22 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
16/01/2025, 16:22 - Vita: anyway just in the car with mum reply in a bit!
16/01/2025, 16:23 - Vita: gonna try get to the bank asap before it closes as well to lodge my canada money hehe:)
16/01/2025, 16:43 - Vita: hahahaha sorry not them failing you over the headrest thats actually so goofy💀
16/01/2025, 16:44 - Vita: like p sure the ones in our car have always been like that lmaoo
16/01/2025, 16:44 - Vita: how many times did you take the test do you mind me asking?
16/01/2025, 16:44 - Vita: yeah the more i think about it i think the guy was just a bit of a dick
16/01/2025, 16:45 - Vita: when he was telling me i failed he was asking me if i’d taken the test before but in such a way that he was assuming i was a re-test? super weird
16/01/2025, 16:46 - Vita: oooh yes we definitely should:)
16/01/2025, 16:46 - Vita: there’s quite a lot about communism in it which gives an overall vibe check hahahaha
16/01/2025, 16:47 - Vita: hahaha sure, I’ll stick it in my back pocket for the next while so;)
16/01/2025, 16:50 - Vita: also he didnt do this :( i asked and he said ‘hm i’ll try and remember to’ and simply didnt lol
16/01/2025, 17:01 - Vita: so again I may need to stop reading the joke before bed hahahaha - there’s a lot about rape in it, and in the nightmare i was being chased by a man who was trying to rape me but every time he caught me I wasnt able to scream despite trying to because my vocal cords were clipped and my muscles would stop working - luckily i kept getting away but he kept catching me again
16/01/2025, 17:02 - Vita: so it was more so the stress of being chased than anything hahaha
16/01/2025, 17:02 - Vita: but at the end of the dream i managed to run into a tattoo shop and tell the people there what was happening
16/01/2025, 17:04 - Vita: (i was also locked out of my house and it was night which is how the whole thing kicked off, but weirdly set in mullingar not dublin)
16/01/2025, 17:04 - Vita: omg fuck yes
16/01/2025, 17:04 - Vita: sooo exciting!!!
16/01/2025, 17:05 - Vita: absolutely amazing!
16/01/2025, 17:05 - Vita: we must make a provisional itinerary on friday evening, seems we chose the right time to go :,)
16/01/2025, 17:06 - Vita: !!! they have some corbusier stuff as well in this !!!
16/01/2025, 17:06 - Vita: very very very exciting
16/01/2025, 17:06 - Vita: no im so glad to hear since the sorolla museum is currently closed!
16/01/2025, 17:07 - Vita: was sad to miss seeing his works so this is a big plus!
16/01/2025, 17:07 - Vita: balls al carrer? I hardly know ‘er!
16/01/2025, 17:08 - Vita: just home now, having a cup of tea to calm down about my driving test result (slightly seething but gonna go on a run to work off the energy hahaha)
16/01/2025, 17:08 - Vita: and then run time!
16/01/2025, 17:08 - Vita: have you seen the clouds today?! they’re absolutely stunning
16/01/2025, 17:08 - Vita: <Media omitted>
16/01/2025, 17:09 - Vita: theyre much better than this, just is the only pic i happened to get!
16/01/2025, 17:10 - Vita: was gonna go gym but think I need to just run this off hahahaha
16/01/2025, 21:50 - Vita: <Media omitted>
16/01/2025, 21:50 - Vita: a very spoilt dog
16/01/2025, 21:58 - Vita: <Media omitted>
16/01/2025, 21:58 - Vita: also! on how to preserve daphne! we should try this!
16/01/2025, 22:03 - Tim Farrelly: Ah a good few times lol, but 3 times without the car failing fairly or unfairly (ie headdrest lol)
16/01/2025, 22:03 - Tim Farrelly: First time v unprepared
16/01/2025, 22:03 - Tim Farrelly: 2nd time, would have passed, but there was one very tricky situation with an elderly driver lol
16/01/2025, 22:03 - Tim Farrelly: 3rd time I passed with flying colours hehe:)
16/01/2025, 22:04 - Tim Farrelly: So it's very normal! And who you get does matter I'm sorry to say
16/01/2025, 22:05 - Tim Farrelly: If you want to go through the process, that could be grounds to get a free repeat potentially if you asked his attitude was like that
16/01/2025, 22:05 - Tim Farrelly: Oh jeez that's not nice
16/01/2025, 22:06 - Tim Farrelly: Ughhh cardio☠️📉😣

16/01/2025, 22:10 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
16/01/2025, 23:15 - Vita: the headrest thing just goes to show how absolutely silly it is hahaha
16/01/2025, 23:16 - Vita: what was the situation with the older driver?! I had an absolute mare with a young guy who nearly drove out on top of me (i had right of way) going 70 in a 30 zone which i think really did it💀
16/01/2025, 23:16 - Vita: hehehe love to see it;)
16/01/2025, 23:17 - Vita: honestly knowing this makes me feel a *lot* better
16/01/2025, 23:17 - Vita: though I am bummed bc was excited to drive us out to glendalough :,) but sure another time!
16/01/2025, 23:17 - Vita: I actually might consider, like 85 a pop is kinda spennyyy
16/01/2025, 23:18 - Vita: right??! the only time it’s not nightmarish is when it’s with you ;)
16/01/2025, 23:18 - Vita: okay I will gather the materials tmw and bring them so we can leave it to marinate while we’re away hehe
16/01/2025, 23:18 - Vita: would be so so good if it worked

17/01/2025, 13:19 - Vita: he actually was not clear on this at all - I’ll explain later (we can trade horror stories) but he barely gave me any feedback other than subjective stuff and then his marking sheet was completely different

17/01/2025, 15:30 - Tim Farrelly: I'm again feel like I'm going a bit crazy, I could have sworn that I had 3 microwave meals left very distinctly as I was counting on us finishing the last ones together before going away, but only see one now...
17/01/2025, 15:30 - Tim Farrelly: Would you like to come over a bit earlier, maybe just before 7, and we can get a mamas revenge?:
17/01/2025, 15:30 - Tim Farrelly: (tragically don't have the T-shirt tho, gave it to my mom for washing)

17/01/2025, 15:58 - Vita: I’m happy to do a bit earlier or else meet you after dinner if you have a lone micro meal you need to eat - though would fuck heavy with a mamas revenge so just lmk:)
17/01/2025, 16:07 - Tim Farrelly: I'm kinda going crazy thinking about what happened to those meals hahahah, like there should have been two. I remember so distinctly not almost going for mamas revenge yesterday as then I'd have a microwave meal left over if we didn't have two together this evening
17/01/2025, 16:07 - Tim Farrelly: Mamas revenge is perf, I'm out of micro meals now haha!
17/01/2025, 16:16 - Vita: that’s actually mad though hmmm
17/01/2025, 16:17 - Vita: perhaps you ate them in a fugue state last night…?😩

17/01/2025, 16:18 - Vita: if it works for you I might just meet you at mamas revenge at 7?! the day somehow got away from me (no gym :,( gonna have to get on it when i’m back!) so might work for me to meet you there!
17/01/2025, 16:18 - Vita: oooh do we have a suspect?!
17/01/2025, 16:18 - Tim Farrelly: Perfect!

24/01/2025, 01:40 - Tim Farrelly: Got to better recognize when I'm too tired to do anything, and should just get to bed... I think I'll be better for this going forward

24/01/2025, 10:55 - Vita: my alarm went off at like 9:30 but with the sound of the wind i was waaay too cosy to get up hehe
👉👈
24/01/2025, 11:37 - Vita: <Media omitted>
24/01/2025, 13:38 - Vita: HAHAHAH my parents were saying the ryuichi sakamoto concert was an absolute pantomime - sounds like we didnt miss much💀
24/01/2025, 13:39 - Tim Farrelly: hello!
24/01/2025, 13:39 - Tim Farrelly: I had a good sleep in
24/01/2025, 13:39 - Tim Farrelly: only sat down for work an hour ago, but have been on WhatsApp/ email since, so am about to block both lol
24/01/2025, 13:41 - Tim Farrelly: called my mom there this morning - ill probably only be heading out to help for a few hours, from about 1-4 or so!
24/01/2025, 13:41 - Tim Farrelly: If you'd like, it could suit well to just sleep over on Sunday!
24/01/2025, 13:41 - Tim Farrelly: Only thing is I'd need to get up early-ish (for me at least, getting out of bed by 10 at least haha)
24/01/2025, 13:42 - Tim Farrelly: my early is different than most
24/01/2025, 13:42 - Tim Farrelly: jeez 20 pages!

24/01/2025, 14:09 - Vita: hehehe very fair, hope the work is going well anyway;)
24/01/2025, 14:10 - Vita: ah great - in that case I’d be down to help out if ye need an extra pair of hands :) but sure just let me know anyway!
24/01/2025, 14:11 - Vita: yeah I’m genuinely happy with whatever, in that case I might see maria on Saturday evening so!
24/01/2025, 14:11 - Vita: but let me know what you’d prefer anyway
24/01/2025, 14:11 - Vita: because I’m so grand with whatever, as unhelpful as that is hahaha
24/01/2025, 14:12 - Vita: right?! and there’s recommended reading! gonna try download one of them from annas archive :,)
24/01/2025, 14:13 - Vita: I had an insanely chill morning +/- a mild jumpscare with the bank… but all sorted now! gonna just work for the day, defo get out for a walk and a run at some stage, and practise some drawing + do some reading later on:)
24/01/2025, 14:14 - Vita: was planning on going for a run like an hour ago but tree branches were still coming off the main road 💀 so thought i’ll give it a few hours lol
24/01/2025, 14:14 - Vita: how about you?! is it all meetings and work mostly? :)
24/01/2025, 14:16 - Tim Farrelly: blocking WhatsApp now for a few hours hahah! I'll text you later, I literally haven't been off it lmao - fov work onw
24/01/2025, 14:30 - Vita: hahahah nw! chat later:)
24/01/2025, 15:14 - Vita: also if I get time tomorrow, might do some baking - and might bring some out to your family on sunday:) I was thinking of making either brownies (same ones as I made for you when we started dating. they happen to be flourless!) or shortbread, they’re the only things I know how to make that are incidentally gluten free hahaha
24/01/2025, 15:14 - Vita: so let me know if you think either would be preferred!
24/01/2025, 16:04 - Tim Farrelly: Texting briefly!
24/01/2025, 16:04 - Tim Farrelly: I think that'd be very helpful if that sounds ok with you!
24/01/2025, 16:04 - Tim Farrelly: We can get some food then too in Howth + Afanti later around 6:30ish perhaps
24/01/2025, 16:05 - Tim Farrelly: share what it is!
24/01/2025, 16:05 - Tim Farrelly: ah jeez, glad to here its sorted hahah, did you get charged unexpectantly, or just money wasn't showing
24/01/2025, 16:05 - Tim Farrelly: probably a good shout hahah
24/01/2025, 16:05 - Tim Farrelly: no meetings today!
24/01/2025, 16:06 - Tim Farrelly: But just need to stay focused on FOV work and ignore other messages and stuff - hence blocking WhatsApp
24/01/2025, 16:06 - Tim Farrelly: haven't gotten too much done thus far, but all necessary stuff
24/01/2025, 16:06 - Tim Farrelly: up to 102 applicants for Hack
24/01/2025, 16:06 - Tim Farrelly: ooo that'd be absolutely lovely!
24/01/2025, 16:06 - Tim Farrelly: whatever you prefer honestly!
24/01/2025, 16:07 - Tim Farrelly: no worries at all if you don't get time though
24/01/2025, 17:04 - Vita: hello!
24/01/2025, 17:05 - Vita: sure! I’m down anyway hehe
24/01/2025, 17:05 - Vita: sounds lovely:)
24/01/2025, 17:06 - Vita: <Media omitted>
24/01/2025, 17:06 - Vita: I downloaded the first off annas archive - and we have the second at home!
24/01/2025, 17:06 - Vita: first one comes highly rated on goodreads anyway:)
24/01/2025, 17:07 - Vita: oh just cheque i’d lodged wasnt showing! but it came from a different bank to AIB so they were saying it’ll take a few more days
24/01/2025, 17:07 - Vita: !!! no way!!! congrats:)
24/01/2025, 17:07 - Vita: sounds like its gonna be a huge one!
24/01/2025, 17:08 - Vita: hehe its no biggie:) Might make brownies so! they’re made with ground almonds as opposed to flour, and olive oil is the binder so you can *technically* say theyre healthy loll
24/01/2025, 17:08 - Vita: this of course is cancelled out by the metric fuckton of sugar required but they’re a lot of fun to make and much less brittle than shortbread for transport!
24/01/2025, 17:10 - Vita: just off an hour long call with the boys haha - got roped into helping out writing komes bio for the past hour hahaha
24/01/2025, 17:10 - Vita: so gonna go for a run and get back to work!
24/01/2025, 17:12 - Vita: I will say I’ve been quite horny today, was thinking about that last time we had sex;) hehe
24/01/2025, 17:13 - Vita: just really looking forward to feeling your hands running over my body again;)
24/01/2025, 20:58 - Tim Farrelly: good evening:)
24/01/2025, 20:59 - Tim Farrelly: I ended up going for a run, and felt v good after that!
24/01/2025, 20:59 - Tim Farrelly: otherwise, not the most productive day but ah sure, going to set an alarm now to stop working by 12 and read then thereafter anwyays
24/01/2025, 21:00 - Tim Farrelly: I have no.3 at least! You're welcome to borrow if we reach my books in storage hahah
24/01/2025, 21:00 - Tim Farrelly: been meaning to check out no.2

24/01/2025, 21:01 - Tim Farrelly: lmao amazing hehe;)
24/01/2025, 21:02 - Tim Farrelly: hahahah you have a knack for them!
24/01/2025, 21:02 - Tim Farrelly: when you're good at something, you do absorb more work... there's some law about that
24/01/2025, 21:02 - Tim Farrelly: "if you respond to emails fast, you get more emails"
24/01/2025, 21:02 - Tim Farrelly: but in a good way!
24/01/2025, 21:02 - Tim Farrelly: did you get out for a run?
24/01/2025, 21:03 - Tim Farrelly: ah coincidentally (not very I'd assume), ive been super horny today too... frankly distracted at times
24/01/2025, 21:03 - Tim Farrelly: only another couple days anyways;)
24/01/2025, 21:12 - Vita: <Media omitted>
24/01/2025, 21:12 - Vita: not you liking this💀
24/01/2025, 21:13 - Tim Farrelly: hahaha I honestly don't remember that - can you send to me?
24/01/2025, 21:13 - Tim Farrelly: is it funny in a bad way?
24/01/2025, 21:14 - Vita: hahahahahaha sure!
24/01/2025, 21:15 - Vita: biggest jumpscare on my study break, diabolical lmao
24/01/2025, 21:22 - Vita: love to see it! glad you got to get out for one:) was the gym closed all day in the end?!
24/01/2025, 21:23 - Vita: ah dw i was the same today :,) but sure you’ve got all of tomorrow as well - and I’m sure you got plenty more than you think done, sounds like the emails are holding you up a good bit
24/01/2025, 21:23 - Vita: ! we can do an exchange so ;)
24/01/2025, 21:23 - Vita: 2 is relatively well reviewed on goodreads :)
24/01/2025, 21:24 - Vita: so would gladly swap you 2 for 3 once you have your collection back
24/01/2025, 21:24 - Vita: or ofc you’re welcome to borrow it any time - though I imagine you’ll want to finish lee miller first!
24/01/2025, 21:25 - Vita: i was *very* proud of one line I came up with. another banger I came up with had to be cut because it was way too problematic for the yearbook hahaha
24/01/2025, 21:25 - Vita: I did indeed! it was fucking freezing, idk if you caught the nip in that wind but sheesh. but glad I got out for one:)
24/01/2025, 21:26 - Vita: hehehe very much love to see it;) wish I was there to distract you some more tbh
24/01/2025, 21:26 - Vita: very very looking forward to sunday;)
24/01/2025, 21:26 - Vita: I *might* have had to touch myself earlier thinking about you in order to focus again hehe
24/01/2025, 21:27 - Tim Farrelly: yeah unfortunately but run was good! I've gotten quite unfit haha
24/01/2025, 21:28 - Tim Farrelly: have to get stuff ready before the match tmrw which is at 5pm!
24/01/2025, 21:28 - Tim Farrelly: and hopefully fit in the gym + a shop
24/01/2025, 21:28 - Tim Farrelly: yes! Plus some more books on my shelf/ in storage, but will take you up on that soon!
24/01/2025, 21:28 - Tim Farrelly: send them on!!
24/01/2025, 21:28 - Tim Farrelly: hahahahahahaha
24/01/2025, 21:29 - Tim Farrelly: what's the other problematic line... is there a way to make it appear less problematic than it is via euphenism... so if you know you know or whatno
24/01/2025, 21:29 - Tim Farrelly: ditto;) Twice tbh
24/01/2025, 21:33 - Vita: (said something to the same effect on insta but just to be clear I was only teasing you with this, as you are a known unhinged reels liker hahaha)
24/01/2025, 21:33 - Vita: hehe hardly, in any case I’m more than happy to help you with the cardio over the weekend;)
24/01/2025, 21:34 - Vita: ahhh very good! I’m hoping to get to the gym tomorrow myself:) what are you gonna hit?
24/01/2025, 21:34 - Vita: absolutely :) my library is your library hehe<3
24/01/2025, 21:35 - Vita: okay so: this requires a bit of context but last summer Kome did an elective in Kansas and a LOT of the consultants were rooting tooting shooting republicans
24/01/2025, 21:36 - Vita: so I wrote something like: Kome’s laidback attitude allowed him to seamlessly navigate the political landscape during his 2024 elective in the states alongside the Kansas Konservative Konsultants
24/01/2025, 21:36 - Vita: it got quickly cut hahahaha
24/01/2025, 21:37 - Vita: <Media omitted>
24/01/2025, 21:37 - Vita: I also wrote the “maintains surgery is just foreplay for a gain of several inches…. of height”
24/01/2025, 21:38 - Vita: which not to scratch my own back but I think thats genius hahahaha
24/01/2025, 21:39 - Vita: Tim you can’t be telling me this, it’s getting me distracted again ;) 
(keep going hehe)
25/01/2025, 00:17 - Vita: off to bed now anyway:) getting up early (for me atm anyway hehe) to practise driving so driving my dad and fred to dun laoighaire for coffee and a walk!
25/01/2025, 00:17 - Vita: night night 😘 xx
25/01/2025, 00:20 - Tim Farrelly: Goodnight! Will text in a bit - I procrastinated FOV work (I just don't enjoy firmware haha, but on it now)
25/01/2025, 00:21 - Tim Farrelly: But I found 1x really cool guy just from a quick look at hack ireland applications! More stars than me on GitHub!

25/01/2025, 00:38 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
25/01/2025, 00:38 - Tim Farrelly: oops meant to highlight the one below
25/01/2025, 02:07 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah today was quite a fail for FOV work, but thankfully, all the firmware needs to be done by Wednesday this week, so then I can move back to AI stuff which I'm more motivated with
25/01/2025, 02:08 - Tim Farrelly: Legs, or arms and back!
25/01/2025, 02:09 - Tim Farrelly: Aww and very much ditto!:

25/01/2025, 14:00 - Vita: right?! would love to see him out west some time on one of the surfing beaches, I bet he’d *love* it
25/01/2025, 14:00 - Vita: ahhh godspeed with the devices!
25/01/2025, 14:00 - Vita: but good plan getting to the gym beforehand, hope its not too busy :,)
25/01/2025, 14:00 - Vita: the endorphins will make you even more effective workwise in any case:)
25/01/2025, 14:01 - Vita: would you be able to do me a massive favour and harvest some for me while they’re still out? you can just put the stems in a glass of water to keep them fresh! no worries if you dont get a chance, was just thinking re: attempting the oil infusion :,)
25/01/2025, 14:01 - Vita: hate to see it have such a short season this year tho:(
25/01/2025, 14:02 - Vita: I’m just in the door now, there was a surprisingly large amount of traffic out!
25/01/2025, 14:03 - Vita: gonna have lunch and do an hour of work before heading to the gym methinks, then more work and seeing maria at some stage later!

25/01/2025, 21:25 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>

25/01/2025, 23:09 - Tim Farrelly: I think ive confused the algorithm by posting back to back hahaha
25/01/2025, 23:09 - Tim Farrelly: its actually mad how long making an insta post takes - I started those at about 8.30!!
25/01/2025, 23:09 - Tim Farrelly: A lot of it is that the app is so glitchy for me when I try to upload stuff!
25/01/2025, 23:09 - Tim Farrelly: but ah sure
25/01/2025, 23:09 - Tim Farrelly: hahahaha
25/01/2025, 23:09 - Tim Farrelly: heinous
25/01/2025, 23:10 - Tim Farrelly: bullish on Freddie's serotonin levels;)
25/01/2025, 23:10 - Tim Farrelly: both lol
25/01/2025, 23:10 - Tim Farrelly: or well, I left well in advanced of the gym closing (30 mins)
25/01/2025, 23:10 - Tim Farrelly: once I had everything ready for the match basically
25/01/2025, 23:11 - Tim Farrelly: ah fantastic! its quite a while since you've gone climbing right?
25/01/2025, 23:12 - Tim Farrelly: insta posts - now I think I'll do a quick hour of work once I clean up my room a bit. And then just chill and do some reading;)
25/01/2025, 23:12 - Tim Farrelly: Meant to get onto thesis work, but Instagram called hahaha
25/01/2025, 23:12 - Tim Farrelly: but again, ah sure, will fit that in tmrw... or actually, will probably do that now after I clean up
25/01/2025, 23:13 - Tim Farrelly: did you get a chance to look at student tickets for the brutalist?
25/01/2025, 23:39 - Vita: <Media omitted>
25/01/2025, 23:40 - Vita: finished and passed the taste test!
25/01/2025, 23:46 - Vita: they’re slightly less gooey than usual in the interest of transportation lol
25/01/2025, 23:47 - Vita: whatt are you serious?!
25/01/2025, 23:47 - Vita: zuck pick it uppp
25/01/2025, 23:47 - Vita: we need that content!!!
25/01/2025, 23:48 - Vita: hahahah - are your reels gone all wholesome now?! ;)
25/01/2025, 23:49 - Vita: a stock worth investing in methinks
25/01/2025, 23:49 - Vita: nice! I had to get my workout in in exactly one hour for the same reasons hehe
25/01/2025, 23:50 - Vita: it really has been! looking forward to doing a bit again:) seems people are getting back into it now that we have a bit more time :,)
25/01/2025, 23:51 - Vita: VERY worthy venture
25/01/2025, 23:52 - Vita: what’s the plan for tomorrow btw, like should I come to yours directly or just get the dart out to sutton from mine?!
25/01/2025, 23:52 - Vita: and had a quick look at cineworld! so if we want imax theres a showing at 7:30 for €16 student, and regular one at 6:00 for €10 for students
25/01/2025, 23:52 - Vita: so realistically I imagine the timing is what will dictate things
25/01/2025, 23:53 - Vita: have you any preference?!
25/01/2025, 23:53 - Vita: it would probably mostly depend on if we wanna get afanti before or after, though it is a three hour movie so 6pm could be awkward re:dinner
25/01/2025, 23:54 - Vita: really looking forward to seeing you in any case :) x
26/01/2025, 00:02 - Vita: also let me know what you prefer here and i can book!
26/01/2025, 00:19 - Tim Farrelly: Ooooooo let's goooo
26/01/2025, 00:19 - Tim Farrelly: Lets do IMAX at 7.30! That might work out nicer!
26/01/2025, 00:20 - Tim Farrelly: Otherwise, could get an earlier dinner
26/01/2025, 00:20 - Tim Farrelly: We can leave howth early
26/01/2025, 00:25 - Tim Farrelly: You might actually let me get back to you tmrw morning about if my parents are emptying much storage tmrw tho! But anyways - if the weathers nice we can hopefully pop up to Howth potentially (another time if not!)
26/01/2025, 00:26 - Tim Farrelly: We can book the movie tickets tmrw (as long as it doesn't look like its gonna book out?) early once the timing is confirmed
26/01/2025, 00:26 - Tim Farrelly: oh god no, f that!
26/01/2025, 00:27 - Tim Farrelly: No just wasn't getting any likes for a bit 👉👈

29/01/2025, 13:55 - Tim Farrelly: Ah I got 77 and a 58!
29/01/2025, 13:55 - Tim Farrelly: Big pity that I took that group project last semester, there would have been at least one other super easy 70+ but ah well!
29/01/2025, 13:56 - Vita: i *think* i managed to find my updated gpa and as expected have lost my first but not by much! so might actually finish with a first with the right balance of luck and elbow grease next sem hahah - but otherwise sitting at a relatively competitive gpa for cushy dublin jobs so happy enough
29/01/2025, 13:56 - Vita: ahhh congrats! thats brilliant:)
29/01/2025, 13:57 - Vita: aww it sounds like that group project really did you over in every aspect lol, thank god you’re free of them now !!

29/01/2025, 19:56 - Tim Farrelly: Much needed for this forearms;)
29/01/2025, 20:11 - Vita: oh yes ;)
29/01/2025, 20:11 - Vita: i’ll most likely be eating it mostly tomorrow after the gym so straight to the glutes you’ll be glad to hear ;)
29/01/2025, 20:11 - Vita: although i must sample a little tonight to ensure its all good… ;)
29/01/2025, 20:12 - Vita: oooh tbf that hot honey👀👀
29/01/2025, 20:12 - Vita: veryy worth missing out on the chicken for methinks hehe
29/01/2025, 21:50 - Vita: first batch out of the oven ;)
29/01/2025, 21:50 - Vita: next up cinnamon buttons to go in!
29/01/2025, 22:45 - Vita: <Media omitted>
29/01/2025, 22:46 - Vita: alrighty the buttons are done, tbh not as much of a fan as of the hazelnut ones, but theyre alright! just needed a lot more spices imo
29/01/2025, 22:46 - Vita: <Media omitted>
29/01/2025, 22:46 - Vita: i mightve set some aside for you hehe
29/01/2025, 22:47 - Vita: the hazelnut ones dont look like much (as in they look very “wholesome” lol) but they taste like roasted hazelnuts:)
29/01/2025, 22:47 - Vita: the smaller ones were a tiny bit of a flop imo, and way more hassle to make! but theyre only bite sized
29/01/2025, 23:01 - Tim Farrelly: Nothing like coming home to the smell of Henry cooking🥰🤌
29/01/2025, 23:03 - Tim Farrelly: Congrats 🥂🎉!!!
29/01/2025, 23:04 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
29/01/2025, 23:13 - Vita: its the little things😍😋🤞
29/01/2025, 23:13 - Vita: home comforts and that xxx
29/01/2025, 23:14 - Vita: awww thank you tim :,) we’ll see what the breakdown is like tmw! hoping those are my actual results hahaha
29/01/2025, 23:14 - Vita: but it must be about a 3.6 since it only brought me down to 0.04 below a first haha
29/01/2025, 23:15 - Vita: glad you had such a great productive day though:) sounded like a good one!!!
29/01/2025, 23:15 - Vita: are the devices all ready to ship for tomorrow?
29/01/2025, 23:15 - Vita: in any case well done:) an early night + some reading is well deserved if you ask me ;)
29/01/2025, 23:17 - Tim Farrelly: Ayyy!
29/01/2025, 23:17 - Tim Farrelly: Soooo close! Awesome to see
29/01/2025, 23:17 - Tim Farrelly: Close enough but not quite!

29/01/2025, 23:18 - Tim Farrelly: Thank you hehe:) Very much looking forward to it!'
29/01/2025, 23:18 - Tim Farrelly: Although am just remembering there's an assignment due tmrw, so might give that a quick go, unfortunately my extra class this semester might be a bit hard, but much better still than the group project!!
29/01/2025, 23:26 - Vita: ah good man omar, hope he’s not stuck there too long!
29/01/2025, 23:27 - Vita: oh no! that’s a real pity - what time is it due tomorrow?!
29/01/2025, 23:27 - Vita: hope you’ll be able to get a semi early night all the same :,)
29/01/2025, 23:27 - Vita: i’m just chilling in bed now - absolutely exhausted but had a great day! still a lil run down i think but glad i was out doing stuff all day:)
29/01/2025, 23:28 - Vita: climbing was a lot lot of fun, myself and aoife are hoping to go again with natasha and then have a girls dinner and movie night after some time soon which would be baller
29/01/2025, 23:28 - Vita: but i really lost some of my skills - I used to be able to do 5s and was barely able to do the 4s today!
29/01/2025, 23:32 - Vita: anyway hope the rest of your work goes well! just a headsup I’ll probs drop the baked goods by yours tomorrow at some stage but will just leave them in the living room for you to grab whenever. hopefully they’ll help fuel your grind anyway:) and lemme know if you need anything else like crispy grapes or whatever!
30/01/2025, 00:04 - Tim Farrelly: Ah he'll likely be in there most of the day hahaha, he works too long I think

30/01/2025, 00:06 - Tim Farrelly: Not tmrw at least!
30/01/2025, 00:07 - Tim Farrelly: I might actually work partly from the room where the engineers hang out tmrw I think!

30/01/2025, 14:13 - Vita: hello:) just popping into town now to run some errands, will probs pop by yours to drop off the biscuits! will let you know when im almost there, but no pressure to pause work on my behalf since i’m rushing about today anyway!
30/01/2025, 14:14 - Vita: but obviously if you do get a moment it’d be lovely to see you!! just wanted to say theres no pressure at all:)
30/01/2025, 14:15 - Vita: my plan is town + errands -> gym -> dinner -> art class -> study + early night :)
30/01/2025, 14:54 - Vita: im 5 mins away now anyway, put in a small surprise to help warm the hands while the heating is acting up hehe

31/01/2025, 16:51 - Vita: i can get a dart to be there for 7:20 or 7:40, which would be better?!
31/01/2025, 17:24 - Tim Farrelly: yeah thats perfect! Let me get back to you to confirm on which  - ill see how my buses line up
31/01/2025, 17:55 - Tim Farrelly: Actually is there one that arrives in Sutton station around 8? That might be ideal for me bus wise
31/01/2025, 17:55 - Tim Farrelly: If its ok, we might not pop into my family today, I think my mom and sister are tired after working at the house all day, and my moms leg has gotten sore so she's headed to bed early
31/01/2025, 17:55 - Tim Farrelly: Another time soon tho!
31/01/2025, 17:56 - Tim Farrelly: I can just hop on the dart then if my bus arrives a bit beforehand
31/01/2025, 17:56 - Tim Farrelly: or if the bus is delayed, you can hop off and we can get a bus up to Howth together from Sutton
31/01/2025, 17:56 - Tim Farrelly: but yeah, is there a dart that arrives in Sutton around 8?
31/01/2025, 17:58 - Vita: should be! let me check:)
31/01/2025, 17:59 - Vita: and this is really really fair, I totally understand!
31/01/2025, 17:59 - Vita: hope your mums leg is okay, has she seen anyone about it yet?
31/01/2025, 18:00 - Vita: <Media omitted>
31/01/2025, 18:00 - Vita: and this should be good, shall i get this one so?! :)
31/01/2025, 18:02 - Tim Farrelly: That's perfect!

01/02/2025, 14:47 - Vita: <Media omitted>
01/02/2025, 14:47 - Vita: I’m going to mexico hehehe
01/02/2025, 14:47 - Vita: actually proper excited now
01/02/2025, 14:48 - Vita: and we’re starting in guatemala so volcano hike 🔜🔜🔜
01/02/2025, 14:48 - Vita: i wanna see if there’s any museums of fridas art etc in mexico when im there too:)
01/02/2025, 15:06 - Vita: also… I *might* have done some preliminary research on how much it’d cost to go to paris to see the fashion exhibit lol - and tbf its actually not that bad (under €150 for flights and 2 nights accommodation!!)
01/02/2025, 15:06 - Vita: was just hardcore procrastinating hahaha
01/02/2025, 15:06 - Vita: okay work time!
01/02/2025, 15:07 - Vita: forgot the gym is closing early today, may not make it:(
01/02/2025, 19:06 - Tim Farrelly: Very exciting!!!
01/02/2025, 19:06 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
01/02/2025, 19:07 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
01/02/2025, 19:07 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
01/02/2025, 19:31 - Vita: ah good evening!
01/02/2025, 19:32 - Vita: glad the match went well!! you must tell me about it when i see ya tomorrow:)

01/02/2025, 19:33 - Vita: <Media omitted>
01/02/2025, 19:33 - Vita: okay so these are the details!!
01/02/2025, 19:33 - Vita: I’m on “self directed learning” (hehe) that week so was just gonna GRINDDDD other than our provisional trip if it was to work
01/02/2025, 19:34 - Vita: buttt do let me know if those dates work for you!!!
01/02/2025, 19:34 - Vita: now the flights are to beauvais *but*
01/02/2025, 19:34 - Vita: <Media omitted>
01/02/2025, 19:35 - Vita: these are the flights, and there’s a 1.5h shuttle bus that goes every 30 mins from beauvais to the centre of paris
01/02/2025, 19:35 - Vita: This message was deleted
01/02/2025, 19:35 - Vita: This message was deleted
01/02/2025, 19:36 - Vita: i was thinking it could potentially be okay since the flight home is super late evening
01/02/2025, 19:36 - Vita: but will have a look at aer lingus same dates;)
01/02/2025, 19:37 - Vita: im thrilled to hear you’re so down though!!! and think it’d be a nice time to go to beat the summer heat and crowds!!
01/02/2025, 19:46 - Vita: This message was deleted
01/02/2025, 19:51 - Vita: This message was deleted
01/02/2025, 19:52 - Vita: This message was deleted
01/02/2025, 19:55 - Vita: okay just unsent a bunch bc i was being really silly and misreading the prices on the accommodation hahahaha
01/02/2025, 19:55 - Vita: had a feeling it was too good to be trie
01/02/2025, 19:55 - Vita: *true
01/02/2025, 19:56 - Vita: let me do a bit more research and get back to you hehe
01/02/2025, 19:56 - Vita: in any case, if we were to go from march 4-6, the flights are €50 return with ryanair and €136 return with aer lingus
01/02/2025, 20:20 - Vita: yeah so unfortunately accom would be closer to €100 each for two nights from the looks of things! but just browsing now hehe
01/02/2025, 20:24 - Vita: (I’m looking at a mix of airbnbs and double room ensuites in nice hostels hehe)
01/02/2025, 20:47 - Vita: I’m just gonna make a notion page and throw in my findings anyway:)
01/02/2025, 20:47 - Vita: okay and then i better get back to work lmaooo
01/02/2025, 23:08 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
01/02/2025, 23:08 - Tim Farrelly: and much earlier
01/02/2025, 23:08 - Tim Farrelly: perhaps too early tbh lol... but an option!
01/02/2025, 23:08 - Tim Farrelly: ah sure we're splitting that in two between us anyways! That small airbnb looks very nice!
01/02/2025, 23:09 - Tim Farrelly: Thanks for doing the research - im about to do some work now before im too tired but ill come back to this later!
01/02/2025, 23:09 - Tim Farrelly: I kinda just lied down in bed for a while not doing anything once I got back... feels like its been a long couple days. Not even sure what work ill do, just know I need to do some before im too tired
01/02/2025, 23:10 - Vita: wait your mind… if we wanted to truly profit, we could consider flying in to CDG with aer lingus early, and potentially get the late ryanair home from beauvais since that goes at like 10 so realistically we’d get the whole day in paris
01/02/2025, 23:10 - Tim Farrelly: ill get back to you on the date soon.... that could potentially be a very busy time for me reviewing Patch applications + launching AFL AI camera stuff on the 15th, but... I think it'd be a lot of fun
01/02/2025, 23:10 - Vita: but sure can think about it more anyway:)
01/02/2025, 23:10 - Tim Farrelly: Do you have any other potential breaks during the semester?
01/02/2025, 23:11 - Tim Farrelly: yep!
01/02/2025, 23:12 - Vita: unfortunately not til right before my exam, and then i’ll be cramming 🥺 but i’m on self directed learning from the 4th to 16th of march!
01/02/2025, 23:13 - Vita: I mean we can even try make it a day trip if it’s super crazy for you! and obviously no hard feelings at all if you wouldnt be able to do it at all, we could potentially do something over the summer anyway before the exhibit closes in the louvre (think its on til mid june/july!)
01/02/2025, 23:14 - Vita: so seriously, whatever suits:)
01/02/2025, 23:14 - Vita: i’d do it tbh!
01/02/2025, 23:14 - Vita: of course! it was a very fun procrastination aide hehe
01/02/2025, 23:15 - Vita: it sure has been - if you can get to bed early tonight please try to! it’ll make you more efficient tomorrow after things being so mad for you!
01/02/2025, 23:16 - Vita: im just doing my physio stretches before cracking into lolita hehe
01/02/2025, 23:19 - Vita: yeah exactly! the one you liked the look of is free cancellation before 3rd march so i’d be tempted to reserve it and then just cancel if we decide to do something different!
01/02/2025, 23:22 - Tim Farrelly: ah and just remembering that the grand palais has officially opened!
01/02/2025, 23:22 - Tim Farrelly: when are those exams?
01/02/2025, 23:22 - Tim Farrelly: but noted!
01/02/2025, 23:23 - Tim Farrelly: I will! I might set an alarm for 1am now anyways:)
01/02/2025, 23:23 - Tim Farrelly: I might get close to finishing lee miller me things hehe:)
01/02/2025, 23:23 - Tim Farrelly: ah very very tempting!
01/02/2025, 23:23 - Tim Farrelly: Little downside too
01/02/2025, 23:25 - Tim Farrelly: how was your day btw?
01/02/2025, 23:32 - Vita: the week of the 28th of april! and then i’m doneeee🤩🤩
01/02/2025, 23:33 - Vita: ah listen………
01/02/2025, 23:33 - Vita: this is highly highly tempting
01/02/2025, 23:33 - Vita: hoping we can make it work anyway!
01/02/2025, 23:33 - Vita: and if not in march then definitely after we finish college!
01/02/2025, 23:34 - Vita: ah good shout! definitely think your body deserves the rest after everything!
01/02/2025, 23:34 - Vita: oooh wonderful!!!
01/02/2025, 23:35 - Vita: ah it was lovely, tbh didnt do all too much other than work though! but definitely needed to sit down and lock in so was a worthy venture:)

03/02/2025, 18:40 - Tim Farrelly: or are they into that sort of stuff?
03/02/2025, 18:40 - Tim Farrelly: not really but flew through the Eileen gray section which I hadn't been to before!
03/02/2025, 18:40 - Vita: yeah but it fell through for a bunch of different reasons! and they are, they both have a somewhat latent interest in the arts hehe
03/02/2025, 18:41 - Vita: oooh ! do send a pic when you get a minute that sounds most intruiging 👀
03/02/2025, 18:41 - Vita: might have to go on the future garden list hehe
03/02/2025, 18:41 - Vita: ah lovelyyy
03/02/2025, 18:42 - Vita: amazing, again no pressure:) we can always go after our exams etc if it doesnt work. but could be a big vibe!
03/02/2025, 18:42 - Vita: im just working atm (veryyy poorly as you can see ;) and then actually heading to oscar and hannahs for dinner ! which I completely forgot about until maybe an hour ago hahaha
03/02/2025, 18:43 - Vita: and then home, more work, and get stuck back into the pedo novel🤪
03/02/2025, 18:44 - Vita: +/- do my art homework if i’m feeling mega productive
03/02/2025, 22:08 - Vita: oh also we’re having dinner for my birthday on the 17th, just at my house with oscar and hannah, and you’re very much invited if you’re around and would like to join us:)

03/02/2025, 22:44 - Vita: also I might potentially have an idea to pitch to you about a london day trip in early summer but can chat about that when i see you next since i know there are a lot of plans in the mix rn hahaha
03/02/2025, 22:44 - Vita: doing an anki bath rn ;)
03/02/2025, 22:45 - Vita: aw yay:) should be nice and chill anyway, and it’ll be nice for you to meet oscar and hannah!
03/02/2025, 22:45 - Vita: hows the work going?!
03/02/2025, 23:16 - Tim Farrelly: Good except my laptop keeps dying every hour agghhhh
03/02/2025, 23:16 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
03/02/2025, 23:16 - Tim Farrelly: I sound like I have turretes when it happens
03/02/2025, 23:16 - Tim Farrelly: Just exclaimed "bitch fucker" lmao
03/02/2025, 23:16 - Tim Farrelly: This has been happening since an update yesterday, no idea what it is
03/02/2025, 23:17 - Tim Farrelly: Interrupts the flow quite annoyingly and wastes about 5 mins
03/02/2025, 23:19 - Tim Farrelly: im back! text in a bit
03/02/2025, 23:20 - Tim Farrelly: works going well anyways otherwise!

03/02/2025, 23:58 - Vita: stealing that one🤩
03/02/2025, 23:58 - Vita: just buy a new one xxxx
03/02/2025, 23:58 - Vita: thats actually a pain in the hole though
03/02/2025, 23:59 - Vita: but hey if its on the hour, could claim pomodoro technique…? ;)
04/02/2025, 00:39 - Tim Farrelly: hahahahaha
04/02/2025, 00:40 - Tim Farrelly: im just out of it happening again
04/02/2025, 00:40 - Tim Farrelly: unfortauntely not quite on the hour:')
04/02/2025, 00:40 - Tim Farrelly: copyright Tim!!!
04/02/2025, 00:40 - Tim Farrelly: I've been feeling like a different colourway;)
04/02/2025, 00:41 - Tim Farrelly: Anyways - still grinding - very productive actually, like good tangible outputs, but not sure if ill get everything that I wanted to done, I was perhaps a bit overambitious
04/02/2025, 01:48 - Tim Farrelly: "bitch you motherfucker"
04/02/2025, 01:48 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
04/02/2025, 01:49 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
04/02/2025, 03:04 - Tim Farrelly: "bitch you motherfucker, fuck you, fuck you" 

_waves hands in the air_
04/02/2025, 10:34 - Vita: noooo!!! in that case just throw out the whole laptop
04/02/2025, 10:34 - Vita: good morning btw:)
04/02/2025, 10:34 - Vita: just getting up to do some work now!
04/02/2025, 10:34 - Vita: brilliant though!!! has it mostly been hack ireland website stuff?
04/02/2025, 10:35 - Vita: let me guess… tim did not get to bed in the half hour after that video was taken…? ;)
04/02/2025, 10:35 - Vita: love the background music to this btw hehe
04/02/2025, 10:46 - Tim Farrelly: good morning
04/02/2025, 10:46 - Tim Farrelly: ughhh woke up early for a call and they didn't show:')
04/02/2025, 10:47 - Tim Farrelly: 0 website stuff actually, just organising recruiting efforts
04/02/2025, 10:47 - Tim Farrelly: not quite
04/02/2025, 10:48 - Tim Farrelly: I think I got to bed around 3:50, but it took me a while to get to sleep, at least an hour I'd say
04/02/2025, 10:48 - Tim Farrelly: So quite low on sleep, but its all good
04/02/2025, 10:57 - Tim Farrelly: sweet and lovely, realising I have a hard time describing smells haha
04/02/2025, 10:57 - Tim Farrelly: we should smell it soon
04/02/2025, 10:57 - Tim Farrelly: ooh yes! we must!
04/02/2025, 10:57 - Tim Farrelly: I also need accountability to make the December post haha!
04/02/2025, 10:58 - Tim Farrelly: hahaha im *always* down for that
04/02/2025, 10:58 - Tim Farrelly: Could even make a nice weekend trip at some stage! Flights tend to be cheap even on the weekend to there
04/02/2025, 11:00 - Tim Farrelly: Btw, I'd love to go to Paris, but I think travelling early March could be a bit stressful potentially tbh, particularly that week, I suspect it'll be extremely busy week for me, and I might kind of need every hour. But hey that exhibition is on till like June or July right! We should make sure to visit it then !
04/02/2025, 11:01 - Tim Farrelly: How are you btw? Sleep well? Get to bed early?
04/02/2025, 11:02 - Vita: noooo :( was it with australia?!
04/02/2025, 11:03 - Vita: i had a feeling ;)
04/02/2025, 11:03 - Tim Farrelly: no a girl in Dogpatch I haven't met yet! grrr
04/02/2025, 11:03 - Vita: aww noo! caffeine tablet mayhaps today or else a nap later could be the ticket hehe
04/02/2025, 11:04 - Vita: ahh bad form on her part!!!
04/02/2025, 11:04 - Tim Farrelly: I think so !
04/02/2025, 11:04 - Vita: i would love to :) we can come up with some adjectives for it then :,)
04/02/2025, 11:04 - Vita: if we do a lib date can always pop out to it!
04/02/2025, 11:05 - Vita: especially when they kick people out at like 9 hehehe
04/02/2025, 11:05 - Vita: YES
04/02/2025, 11:05 - Vita: dw I will be cracking the whip 😤😤
04/02/2025, 11:05 - Vita: full accountability
04/02/2025, 11:05 - Vita: lovee to see it;)
04/02/2025, 11:06 - Vita: yeah see I’m going to that garden with my parents for two days in early june but flying back from london, but i was thinking maybe if you flew to london and met me there (provided the dates suited ofc) we could spend a day or two!
04/02/2025, 11:06 - Vita: could be a good vibe since i’d be over in england anyway!
04/02/2025, 11:08 - Vita: also that’s completely understandable, tbh when you mentioned going to estonia as well I thought it might be a bit overwhelming hahaha
04/02/2025, 11:08 - Vita: but yeah i’d love to do a little trip during my summer break in june anyway so could do then!
04/02/2025, 11:09 - Vita: once I start working in july things’ll likely be crazy for me for a few weeks but early june could be the shout:)
04/02/2025, 11:09 - Vita: and that said once I’m settled into work I’ll be very much liquid enough and ready to do weekend trips spontaneously!
04/02/2025, 11:10 - Vita: I’m good!!! still in bed;) but doing anki so like… it’s *technically* productive hehehe
04/02/2025, 11:11 - Vita: i slept pretty well, but stayed up super late reading - halfway through lolita now hahaha its suchh a trainwreck (or rather the main guy is)
04/02/2025, 11:11 - Vita: have no clue what time i got to bed at and am at peace not knowing🤩
04/02/2025, 11:12 - Vita: plan today anyway is grind and get to the gym at some stage! and maybe pop into town because I have a couple of things I wanna get ahead of valentines day hehe - but that might end up being tomorrow depending on how locked in I am!
04/02/2025, 11:19 - Tim Farrelly: Text in a bit! But this sounds lovely and thanks for understanding on Paris !
04/02/2025, 11:19 - Tim Farrelly: And jeez, didn't realize you start in July !
04/02/2025, 11:19 - Tim Farrelly: Not to be a fuck boy... but we better make the most of June so;)
04/02/2025, 11:20 - Tim Farrelly: Ok about to shower now anyways and have some food before getting stuck back in:)
04/02/2025, 11:20 - Vita: tim i’m just gonna be working i’m not dying in july💀💀💀
04/02/2025, 11:20 - Tim Farrelly: Hahahahaha
04/02/2025, 11:20 - Vita: the way in which this sounds like the “ oh noo… you’re leaving?? :)” reel HAHAHA
04/02/2025, 11:21 - Tim Farrelly: That's what I had in mind hahahahah
04/02/2025, 11:21 - Tim Farrelly: Someone has a girl over!!!!!!!!!
04/02/2025, 11:21 - Tim Farrelly: !!!!!!!!!!!!!
04/02/2025, 11:21 - Vita: WHATTT
04/02/2025, 11:21 - Tim Farrelly: I'm not sure if it's Henry!!!!
04/02/2025, 11:21 - Vita: 💀💀💀💀
04/02/2025, 11:22 - Tim Farrelly: It sounded like her voice was coming from there coming out the door
04/02/2025, 11:22 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
04/02/2025, 11:22 - Vita: (I will still be able to see you the same amount as we currently do once I start working just will probably be slightly less flexible hahaha)
04/02/2025, 11:22 - Tim Farrelly: Yes it's Henry!!! Can hear in the hallway!!!!
04/02/2025, 11:22 - Tim Farrelly: Omfg
04/02/2025, 11:22 - Tim Farrelly: Good for him!
04/02/2025, 11:23 - Vita: HAHAHAHA YOU PEEPING TOM
04/02/2025, 11:23 - Tim Farrelly: Guilty lmao
04/02/2025, 11:23 - Vita: wait are they fucking or does he just have someone over? hahaha
04/02/2025, 11:23 - Vita: still good for him!!
04/02/2025, 11:23 - Vita: maybe he’ll start taking out the bins if he has a gf xxx
04/02/2025, 11:24 - Tim Farrelly: Well, no fucking sounds, but I was assuming that she'd slept over potentially and they're getting up and out now
04/02/2025, 11:24 - Tim Farrelly: But it could literally just be that he has a friend over
04/02/2025, 11:24 - Vita: ooooooooooh
04/02/2025, 11:24 - Vita: henry you spicy boy
04/02/2025, 11:24 - Tim Farrelly: Hahahahahaha
04/02/2025, 11:24 - Tim Farrelly: Text in a bit haha!
04/02/2025, 11:24 - Tim Farrelly: Techno + shower time hehe:)
04/02/2025, 11:24 - Vita: hahahaha nw!
04/02/2025, 11:26 - Vita: yeah, was gonna suggest we do a summer holiday type trip in june, since like of course I’ll have annual leave and stuff but might be a couple months before I have more than weekends off!
04/02/2025, 11:26 - Vita: but again, will be very much up for spontaneous trips when I’m working too:)
04/02/2025, 11:27 - Vita: hahahahah dw - that we will
04/02/2025, 11:27 - Tim Farrelly: Let's do some planning/ thinking when we meet - I'd be very down!
04/02/2025, 11:27 - Vita: provided this isnt a ruse to have a hot boy summer after 😩😩🫦

05/02/2025, 00:01 - Tim Farrelly: (given the circumstance under which it died)
05/02/2025, 00:01 - Tim Farrelly: But sooooooo annoying still
05/02/2025, 00:02 - Tim Farrelly: This can't go on much longer
05/02/2025, 00:02 - Vita: methinks an italian level of handwaving is warranted in such situations
05/02/2025, 00:02 - Vita: free
05/02/2025, 00:02 - Vita: *frrr
05/02/2025, 00:02 - Vita: especially while you have so much going on at work oof
05/02/2025, 00:02 - Vita: like severely not ideal for the old ergonomics
05/02/2025, 00:03 - Vita: but then also getting a new one (if that even was an option) is a pain in the hole itself :,(
05/02/2025, 00:03 - Vita: bit of a catch 22
05/02/2025, 00:04 - Vita: good shout!
05/02/2025, 00:04 - Vita: for reading them or being involved in them?! sounds fascinating either way!

05/02/2025, 00:06 - Vita: ooh this could be a very big vibe!
05/02/2025, 00:06 - Vita: feel like I havent had sushi in ages :,)
05/02/2025, 00:07 - Vita: but this is a good backup! though if we do get sushi anyway I could bring ingredients for moscow mules or a cocktail of our choosing?!
05/02/2025, 00:08 - Vita: ah godspeed! and heres to no more laptop mishaps
05/02/2025, 00:09 - Vita: em also know this might sound small and silly, but i really like when you send me goodnight kisses. it makes me feel close to you, and I’ve missed them lately:,)

07/02/2025, 20:40 - Vita: that’s actually horrific
07/02/2025, 20:41 - Vita: I’m sure he’s aware in himself but if he becomes unwell over the next few weeks/gets a yellow tinge to his eyes he should head to a doctor to get some antibiotics

07/02/2025, 22:34 - Tim Farrelly: he would have been drunk
07/02/2025, 22:34 - Tim Farrelly: the water would have been freezing, and he would have been wearing clothes (have you ever swam in clothes, they can get heavy as fuck, never mind a full hoodie + jacket)

07/02/2025, 23:07 - Vita: no thats actually horrific
07/02/2025, 23:08 - Vita: yeah I was thinking the temperature of it alone, he’s so lucky he didn’t get hypothermia or get weighed down by the clothes

08/02/2025, 11:19 - Vita: sounds lovely though, can never say no to a bit of tchaikovsky ;)
08/02/2025, 11:20 - Vita: I am no expert but would certainly concur with chatgpt… is it in your bathroom or where is it?!
08/02/2025, 15:26 - Tim Farrelly: oh oops forgot! yep it would be a lter thing, from like 7:30 till like 9:30 so would be best to eat early!

11/02/2025, 17:51 - Tim Farrelly: Jeez sorry for leaving you on read
11/02/2025, 17:52 - Tim Farrelly: I opened it first when I was out for a walk, and thought I'd just respond properly once back home with warm hands, but got distracted by work messages lol, and then opened again, just as Omar called, then forgot and wait straight back to work hahah
11/02/2025, 17:53 - Tim Farrelly: With that being said, I feel like I'm about to be much more on top of things, and can do us my attention back towards FOV now:)
11/02/2025, 17:53 - Tim Farrelly: Just a final bitta patch work today + keeping up with volunteers
11/02/2025, 17:54 - Tim Farrelly: Ahhh no, did you get any sleep at all?
11/02/2025, 17:55 - Tim Farrelly: On the bright side, you'll be exhausted by the time this evening comes around:)
11/02/2025, 17:55 - Tim Farrelly: Was there anything on your mind last night? Or does that just happen sometime?
11/02/2025, 17:56 - Tim Farrelly: Awwwww hehehe :) Love you too

11/02/2025, 18:15 - Vita: did you have to be up early today or did you get a good sleep?
11/02/2025, 18:16 - Vita: I did, but as to how much exactly I’ve no idea - was trying not to go on my phone!
11/02/2025, 18:17 - Vita: i was just thinking about loads of silly things, and not even bad stuff! just like intern jobs, how my ring is gonna turn out, how i’m gonna structure my study over the next while - all super benign but i think my mind was just on 100 after not working much over the break :,)
11/02/2025, 18:18 - Vita: I also became acutely aware at some point I couldnt sleep and it was getting late which worsened the situation in that I was trying too hard too sleep haahaha
11/02/2025, 18:18 - Vita: my evil plan uncovered!!!!!!!
11/02/2025, 18:18 - Vita: oooh fuck yeah ;) sure we can see whats what on friday anywho hehe

11/02/2025, 20:05 - Tim Farrelly: I had a good sleep in thankfully I woke up at about 1:00! But I didn't get to sleep until about 5:00 last night I think so we'll get to sleep earlier this evening Just have to get some work done now :)

11/02/2025, 20:30 - Vita: i’m just studying this evening! I might do some anki in the bath if im feeling fancy - but had such a crazy unproductive day (really lovely! but v unproductive! hoping to lock in tomorrow and go to placement, stay til the afternoon/evening studying or gathering histories, then hit the gym on the way home! just forgot my lunch today so couldnt stay hehe)
11/02/2025, 20:31 - Vita: but yeah nothing mad, there was talk of mother reilleys pub quiz but people were exhausted from being back in so early hahaha so think that’s deferred to next week
11/02/2025, 20:32 - Vita: so need to lock in til friday :) but gonna do another couple hours here, but fuck it I will defo take a bath so im nice and warm for bed :,)
11/02/2025, 20:32 - Vita: have been spending waaay too much time on r/juniordoctors because the intern jobs list came out so im trying to figure out what to rank first hahaha

11/02/2025, 21:39 - Tim Farrelly: Trust reddit
11/02/2025, 21:39 - Tim Farrelly: You're pretty confident in specializing in psych right?
11/02/2025, 22:19 - Vita: omg fuck this looks good hehehe
11/02/2025, 22:19 - Vita: absolutely loveee to see it
11/02/2025, 22:22 - Vita: well deserved:) glad they gave a good portion of chicken hehe
11/02/2025, 22:22 - Vita: have to say the sprout too good to go is just such excellent value hahaha
11/02/2025, 22:22 - Vita: if you say so ;)
11/02/2025, 22:24 - Vita: it v much was :) looking forward to getting in and seeing more patients tomorrow
11/02/2025, 22:24 - Vita: met a really lovely guy today who had a kidney transplant that his wife gave him :,) they’ve been married for 50 yrs!!
11/02/2025, 22:26 - Vita: no its actually soothed me a great deal haha, I live in a bubble of high achievers which was slightly stressing me about job choices but looks like it should be graaand
11/02/2025, 22:27 - Vita: ah yeah, like that could well change since I’m an adaptable girl but its 100% top of my list!
11/02/2025, 23:45 - Vita: off to bed now anyway:) night tim! godspeed with the rest of the work xx

11/02/2025, 23:46 - Tim Farrelly: the sprout was absolutely delicision
11/02/2025, 23:46 - Tim Farrelly: declicious* !
11/02/2025, 23:46 - Tim Farrelly: hope you get a good sleep!
11/02/2025, 23:49 - Tim Farrelly: Ah couldn't wait hehe
11/02/2025, 23:49 - Tim Farrelly: Very very nice
11/02/2025, 23:49 - Tim Farrelly: Work continues, but going to set an alarm for like 2.30 now I think, so will get to bed a bit earlier tonight:)
12/02/2025, 01:09 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
12/02/2025, 03:30 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
12/02/2025, 03:30 - Tim Farrelly: Awwwww!!
12/02/2025, 03:31 - Tim Farrelly: That's the attitude!!
12/02/2025, 03:31 - Tim Farrelly: Just need some perspective
12/02/2025, 03:31 - Tim Farrelly: And is that what you'd be doing next year? Or is it the year after? Like is next year still general?
12/02/2025, 03:32 - Tim Farrelly: Look forward to it anyways!!
12/02/2025, 03:34 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
12/02/2025, 03:35 - Tim Farrelly: Also sending this as a reminder to potentially look at some trips as I'm not going to Estonia lol, that ended up not happening
12/02/2025, 03:56 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
12/02/2025, 07:03 - Vita: good morning:)
12/02/2025, 07:03 - Vita: just waiting on the bus now, slept a little better last night thank god! but need to read more before bed i think to really help turn off!
12/02/2025, 07:03 - Vita: had a very cheeky scroll last night and paid the price
12/02/2025, 07:03 - Vita: hehehehe ;) glad you like
12/02/2025, 07:04 - Vita: always more where that came from👀
12/02/2025, 07:05 - Vita: that was for kiko kostadinov! think it might’ve actually been his first women’s collection:)
12/02/2025, 07:06 - Vita: oooh i’d love to! I havent been to a comedy show in absolutely ages, count me in
12/02/2025, 07:08 - Vita: exactly! I think also the mater is just super competitive, but looking at the jobs lists i’m not even sure i’ll put it down bc only a few combos are standing out to me
12/02/2025, 07:10 - Vita: next year is still general! but if I get lucky I might get 3 months of psych (which v much hoping for) -  it’ll all be fairly general until I get on the scheme, but apparently as an irish student with a highish GPA who’s motivated I should get on it quickly; only thing I need to do in the meantime is build up my CV to be absolutely sure I get my entire training scheme in dublin (which is already basically confirmed but just to really cement that)
12/02/2025, 07:11 - Vita: nice thing about the psych scheme is that they do encourage people to take a year out about halfway through so if I wanted to do research in UCL or travel the world I could totally do that!
12/02/2025, 07:12 - Vita: oh what happened?! did it just not get organized in time or what was the vibe
12/02/2025, 07:13 - Vita: yeah sure we can have a little look anyway - if we were considering march i’d probs only be able to do one night as well but also need to think about summer locations if you’re still down:)
12/02/2025, 07:13 - Vita: ah glad you’ll be getting some time for your sexy website!!
12/02/2025, 07:13 - Vita: show me the gradient when you have it done!
12/02/2025, 07:17 - Vita: so I just deleted the app, unfortunately as far as I know our chat would be lost though because you deleted your account :,(
12/02/2025, 07:18 - Vita: wouldve been so funny to see our initial interactions!! hahaha
12/02/2025, 13:52 - Tim Farrelly: I can relate! Glad to hear though
12/02/2025, 13:52 - Tim Farrelly: Although sorry I did get a good sleep last night I just know that reading really helps
12/02/2025, 13:54 - Tim Farrelly: Ah cool! Haven't heard of him tbh
12/02/2025, 14:10 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
12/02/2025, 14:50 - Vita: guess who just asked a man with one leg if he gets breathless going up stairs😍😍😋🌬️🌬️
12/02/2025, 14:58 - Vita: will be sure to tonight so:)
12/02/2025, 14:58 - Vita: and glad you’re having a good day! enjoy dogpatch!
12/02/2025, 14:59 - Vita: i’m almost finished here, gonna hit the gym sleepily (exhausted but legs needs doing) then home to study!
12/02/2025, 18:11 - Vita: <Media omitted>
12/02/2025, 18:11 - Vita: just home from a relatively mid leg day - was fine but no massive pump tbh
12/02/2025, 18:12 - Vita: gonna have a cup of tea and get down to work anyway:)
12/02/2025, 21:28 - Vita: hey! hows your day been?:)
12/02/2025, 21:37 - Tim Farrelly: Hello!
12/02/2025, 21:37 - Tim Farrelly: Just in the gym, hitting legs
12/02/2025, 21:38 - Tim Farrelly: But again, so busy!! Got a squat racks as soon as I came in thankfully, and see the leg press is free too (last set of squatting)
12/02/2025, 21:38 - Tim Farrelly: Got a sprout just before with extra chicken hehe, so had to hit legs
12/02/2025, 21:38 - Tim Farrelly: Text in a bit
12/02/2025, 21:38 - Tim Farrelly: Busy day tho thus far!
12/02/2025, 21:41 - Tim Farrelly: Hahahahaha you really are the best
12/02/2025, 21:41 - Tim Farrelly: "so why did you get divorced?"';)
12/02/2025, 21:41 - Tim Farrelly: Amazingggg

12/02/2025, 22:02 - Vita: about to head towards shower and relaxing in half an hour so will send a vm about my day then:)
12/02/2025, 22:02 - Vita: no it was FULLY giving that ahahahaha
12/02/2025, 22:02 - Vita: thank fuck the guy had a good sense of humour
12/02/2025, 22:03 - Vita: i’ll explain when I see you but i did have good reason for asking, just happened to be quite tired and forgot the obvious limiting factor ahahaha
12/02/2025, 22:03 - Vita: not yet;) unfortunately it was so good i finished the one i ate in a mere few bites (not to blow my own whistle or anything hehe)
12/02/2025, 22:04 - Vita: snap! i hit legs earlier too!!
12/02/2025, 22:04 - Vita: but love to see it!!! hope you got a good booty burn hehe
12/02/2025, 22:13 - Vita: also update on my seemingly elusive birthday dinner hahaha - it might end up being the first week of march instead of sunday because my brother and hannah arent around and then everyone has ridiculous schedule clashes for the rest of feb ahaha
12/02/2025, 22:31 - Tim Farrelly: Didn't have the budget for it! Will hopefully go to Cork tho
12/02/2025, 22:31 - Tim Farrelly: 100% for summer anyways!! But yes, let's :)
12/02/2025, 22:31 - Tim Farrelly: Unlikely to be tonight actually, need to do FOV work lol

18/02/2025, 07:04 - Vita: hahahah why did i have a feeling you werent gonna can it at 2am… ;)
18/02/2025, 07:05 - Vita: was thinking tho something you could do is ask chatgpt to help make you a schedule to maximise productivity over the next while??
18/02/2025, 07:05 - Vita: just bc there’s been a couple nights here where you’ve said you were working late but didnt get as much done as you’d hoped
18/02/2025, 07:06 - Vita: you’re defo smashing it but just an idea to even better things hehe
18/02/2025, 07:06 - Vita: anyway yeah wednesday study date would be lovely, i’d need to get to bed around midnight though bc i’m in a hella sleep deficit atm :,(
18/02/2025, 07:06 - Vita: but i would love to see you!
18/02/2025, 15:56 - Tim Farrelly: Oh that's actually a very worthy experiment!!!
18/02/2025, 15:56 - Tim Farrelly: Thank you for suggesting
18/02/2025, 15:56 - Tim Farrelly: Hahah yes ofc!
18/02/2025, 15:57 - Tim Farrelly: I'm just tryna think what would be best hack Ireland wise... I can see you on Friday, but I'll need to be up quite early, and tbh, might have some organizing bits to do so that's probably not a good shout!
18/02/2025, 15:57 - Tim Farrelly: Would Wednesday or Thursday suit you best to meetup?
18/02/2025, 15:57 - Tim Farrelly: But yeah, definitely a study date + bed early. I'll need to be up early on Saturday
18/02/2025, 15:58 - Tim Farrelly: And also, Sunday (I could be absolutely wrecked so perhaps not) or Monday
18/02/2025, 17:05 - Vita: let me know if you do it/how you get on!
18/02/2025, 17:06 - Vita: no problem! could be an idea since like me you have the tendency to overwork opportunistically. could be a way to maintain balance and efficiency
18/02/2025, 17:06 - Vita: i’m gonna be up early anyway on sat, but yeah i’d like an early night that night I think to recoup sleep debt
18/02/2025, 17:07 - Vita: so perhaps thursday I might pop to yours after drawing?!
18/02/2025, 17:07 - Vita: yeah sure just lemme know what suits. I might be dreadfully hungover sunday so monday could be better maybe hahah
18/02/2025, 17:50 - Tim Farrelly: Perfect!
18/02/2025, 17:51 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
18/02/2025, 17:54 - Vita: just in the gym! opened by accident hehe but reply in a bit!
18/02/2025, 17:54 - Vita: hello btw hehe
18/02/2025, 17:55 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
18/02/2025, 17:55 - Tim Farrelly: Whatcha hitting? I should hopefully make it in later!
18/02/2025, 18:18 - Vita: hey! i’m just home from the gym hehe
18/02/2025, 18:18 - Vita: glad you’ll be getting out for something later though!
18/02/2025, 18:20 - Vita: i think generally super old super wealthy men like talking about tombstone prices and how it feels to be super old. also because this is the hundred millionaire he might like to talk about his struggles with poverty not being a billionaire etc. must be difficult
18/02/2025, 18:20 - Vita: anyway you’ll get better at it as time goes on hehe
18/02/2025, 18:22 - Vita: i think maybe set hours that you’ll respond quickly to people? idk maybe chatgpt will have a better idea but just generally from what i’ve seen it’s good to have boundaries of some sort on that type of thing

20/02/2025, 12:23 - Tim Farrelly: Remind me what time you finish up drawing! I'll be heading out to swords soon - just in the middle of a leg session rn🙏
20/02/2025, 12:23 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah jeez the rain was *loud* against my windows earlier
20/02/2025, 12:55 - Vita: hehehe
20/02/2025, 12:56 - Vita: ah yes! I intend on doing that tomorrow/saturday! getting into the swing of things though thankfully, just was a matter of actually sitting down at my desk :,)
20/02/2025, 12:56 - Vita: we’ll be finished at 9:30! so i can stroll to yours right after:)
20/02/2025, 12:57 - Vita: enjoy the legs! i’m hoping to hit the same later

20/02/2025, 13:38 - Vita: i’m gonna aim to start getting up at between 7:30 and 8 once my placements are finished - lord knows if that’ll actually happen but  it would be more in line with my natural midnight bedtime
20/02/2025, 13:38 - Vita: the past few weeks have been grim out bc like i literally cannot sleep before 11pm
20/02/2025, 13:41 - Tim Farrelly: Aww jeez
20/02/2025, 13:41 - Tim Farrelly: For the whole semester right!? That's quite exciting
20/02/2025, 13:42 - Tim Farrelly: Let's see if this bus shows up for swords lol
20/02/2025, 13:42 - Tim Farrelly: I kinda ran to get here early in case it arrived early. But it's disappeared from the time board, and it's 5 mins late now
20/02/2025, 13:43 - Tim Farrelly: Ah it's reappeared on the timetable!
20/02/2025, 14:15 - Vita: yes! very very good - i’ll probs be still going in to see patients but like i can do that whenever i want to so its way less dependent on being in *so* early (will still have to be in early but only when i want to be)
20/02/2025, 14:15 - Vita: thank god! i hope you’re safely on it now:,)
20/02/2025, 14:15 - Vita: and just in time with the weather clearing up!

21/02/2025, 14:07 - Tim Farrelly: kinda woke up at 9:30, but slept in till about 12 lol
21/02/2025, 14:07 - Tim Farrelly: I was behind on sleep tbf
21/02/2025, 14:07 - Vita: yes and you’ll need it big time for this weekend !!!
21/02/2025, 14:07 - Tim Farrelly: Gonna get out for a walk - and maybe a mamas revenge now me thinks
21/02/2025, 14:08 - Vita: oh for suree:)
21/02/2025, 14:08 - Vita: i got free lunch bc we were getting cardiology teaching
21/02/2025, 14:08 - Vita: it was case based and omg the case was WILDDDD
21/02/2025, 14:08 - Vita: 30 year old man presenting with *severe* fluid overload consistent with heart failure +/- sepsis +/- penis gangrene
21/02/2025, 14:09 - Vita: they got rid of THIRTY LITRES of fluid off this man over the course of 6 days in icu and have another twenty to go💀💀
21/02/2025, 14:09 - Vita: he came in at 130kg and he’s now like 95?
21/02/2025, 14:10 - Vita: he’s recovering well at present but literally sooo wild - the cause of his heart failure was lifestyle which the consultant was saying is more common in the states but theyre starting to see it here more now
21/02/2025, 14:14 - Tim Farrelly: oh jesus christ
21/02/2025, 14:14 - Tim Farrelly: what
21/02/2025, 14:14 - Tim Farrelly: mad
21/02/2025, 14:15 - Tim Farrelly: just a very sedentary lifestyle?
21/02/2025, 14:17 - Vita: pretty much - like he was already high BMI but he lost his job and had already been working from home as a software engineer, and then his long term partner ended things so over the christmas period he was just staying indoors all the time, only getting out of his chair to collect takeaways
21/02/2025, 14:18 - Vita: he thought he was gaining weight from general sedentery-ness which is technically true in a roundabout way, but what it actually was was fluid overload because he was in heart failure that entire time
21/02/2025, 14:19 - Vita: like he gained ?40kg in a period of 2 months apparently
21/02/2025, 14:19 - Vita: but had no family here to check in on him so nobody saw how acutely unwell he was hence the late presentation
21/02/2025, 14:20 - Vita: he has a supportive family in dubai tho so the plan is for him to move in with them there when he’s safe to travel
21/02/2025, 14:20 - Vita: anyway yeah the whole thing was jawdropping
21/02/2025, 14:20 - Vita: his oxygen saturation on admission was about 40% which is barely compatible with life considering most people hang between 94-98

23/02/2025, 12:45 - Vita: but yeah lmk what time suits to come - it’d probs be closer to 3 or 4 that i’d be able to make it since downstairs looks like it’ll be a big job😅

24/02/2025, 19:31 - Tim Farrelly: partly! although there's still a good bit to do for it I think - we need to wrap things up, reach out to sponsors, talk about things with Dogpatch (they'll get a fine for someone hitting the fire alarm, and I hope we have the cash to cover that)
24/02/2025, 19:31 - Tim Farrelly: and need to make sure its in a good place to happen again next year - we need to find the right people to help run it
24/02/2025, 19:31 - Tim Farrelly: yes lets1

26/02/2025, 22:03 - Vita: have there been any studies done into the use of ashwagandha in reducing mood lability in borderline personality disorder and other labile psychiatric conditions
26/02/2025, 22:14 - Tim Farrelly: I can certainly look into studies on ashwagandha's effects on mood lability in borderline personality disorder (BPD) and other psychiatric conditions with mood instability. To make this as useful as possible, could you clarify:

Are you looking for only clinical trials, or would you like broader sources such as case studies, reviews, or anecdotal evidence?
Would you like a focus on BPD specifically, or should I include conditions like bipolar disorder, PTSD, or generalized anxiety disorder if they discuss mood lability?
Do you need details on dosages and mechanisms of action as well?
Let me know and I’ll get started!
26/02/2025, 22:14 - Tim Farrelly: clarifying questions ^
26/02/2025, 22:14 - Vita: hehehe very professional!
26/02/2025, 22:15 - Vita: I’m looking for clinical trials and reviews. Please exclude anecdotal evidence and specifically focus on personality disorders such as BPD which have a labile affective component
26/02/2025, 22:16 - Vita: no need for mechanisms of action but doseage over 300mg per day only
26/02/2025, 22:16 - Tim Farrelly: done - its research hehe

26/02/2025, 22:28 - Vita: its very niche and left field so would genuinely be surprised if there are any rcts on it for a plethora of reasons - hence why i asked da robot hahaha
26/02/2025, 22:30 - Tim Farrelly: I'll gather clinical trials and reviews that investigate the use of ashwagandha in reducing mood lability in personality disorders, particularly BPD, with dosages of 300mg or more per day. I'll exclude anecdotal evidence and unrelated psychiatric conditions. I'll compile the findings into a report and include a citation table for easy reference. I'll update you once the research is complete.

# Introduction  
Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and certain other personality disorders are characterized by marked mood lability and emotional dysregulation. Patients with BPD often experience rapid shifts in mood, heightened anxiety, and difficulty regulating emotional responses. While psychotherapy is the mainstay of treatment, there is growing interest in adjunctive natural compounds that might stabilize mood swings. **Ashwagandha** (_Withania somnifera_), an Ayurvedic herb known as an “adaptogen,” has demonstrated anti-stress and anxiolytic effects in clinical studies ([A prospective, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study of safety and efficacy of a high-concentration full-spectrum extract of ashwagandha root in reducing stress and anxiety in adults - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23439798/#:~:text=Materials%20and%20methods%3A%20%20A,During%20the%20treatment)) ([A prospective, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study of safety and efficacy of a high-concentration full-spectrum extract of ashwagandha root in reducing stress and anxiety in adults - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23439798/#:~:text=Results%3A%20%20The%20treatment%20group,0006%29%20in%20the)). Its potential to reduce stress reactivity and anxiety suggests it might help modulate mood lability. This report reviews clinical trials and systematic reviews examining ashwagandha’s effects on mood instability in personality disorders (especially BPD), focusing on studies using ≥300 mg per day. We exclude anecdotal evidence and studies of unrelated conditions (e.g. depression without emotional dysregulation).  

# Summary of Clinical Findings  
**Evidence Base:** Direct research on ashwagandha for BPD-specific mood swings is very limited. No large randomized trial to date has focused exclusively on ashwagandha in BPD. However, several clinical trials in related contexts (chronic stress, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia) have explored ashwagandha’s impact on mood and emotional symptoms. These studies generally used moderate to high doses (300–1000 mg daily) of standardized ashwagandha extract and can inform its potential role in stabilizing mood lability.  

**Stress and Anxiety Trials:** Multiple placebo-controlled trials have found that ashwagandha significantly reduces stress and anxiety symptoms, which are often triggers for mood instability. For example, Chandrasekhar et al. (2012) gave 600 mg/day of high-concentration root extract to adults with chronic stress and observed **significant reductions in all stress-assessment scale scores** and cortisol levels compared to placebo ([A prospective, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study of safety and efficacy of a high-concentration full-spectrum extract of ashwagandha root in reducing stress and anxiety in adults - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23439798/#:~:text=Results%3A%20%20The%20treatment%20group,0006%29%20in%20the)). Participants reported improved well-being, and the herb was well-tolerated. A 2014 systematic review of human trials for anxiety (5 studies) concluded that **ashwagandha consistently led to greater anxiety score improvements than placebo** in all trials reviewed ([(PDF) An Alternative Treatment for Anxiety: A Systematic Review of ...](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268795467_An_Alternative_Treatment_for_Anxiety_A_Systematic_Review_of_Human_Trial_Results_Reported_for_the_Ayurvedic_Herb_Ashwagandha_Withania_somnifera#:~:text=All%20five%20studies%20concluded%20that,outcomes%20on%20anxiety%20or)). These findings suggest ashwagandha’s anxiolytic effects may help blunt the intensity of emotional swings by lowering baseline anxiety and stress reactivity. Notably, benefits tend to be dose-dependent, with **500–600 mg/day producing greater stress reduction** than lower doses ([
	Ashwagandha: Is it helpful for stress, anxiety, or sleep? - Health Professional Fact Sheet
](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Ashwagandha-HealthProfessional/#:~:text=to%206%2C000%20mg%20of%20root,mg%2Fday%20than%20with%20lower%20doses)).  

**Personality Disorders and Mood Lability:** There are no published RCTs *specifically in BPD populations* using ashwagandha. Nevertheless, some evidence from adjacent psychiatric conditions (which also involve mood dysregulation) is encouraging. In an early trial, Andrade et al. (2000) treated patients with generalized anxiety (some with adjustment disorders) using ~500 mg/day of ashwagandha. They found **significant decreases in anxiety ratings (Hamilton Anxiety Scale)** with ashwagandha compared to placebo ([
            Effects of Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) on Stress and the Stress-Related Neuropsychiatric Disorders Anxiety, Depression, and Insomnia - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8762185/#:~:text=6%20weeks%20Placebo%2039%20adults,64)). Although not a BPD study, reduced anxious mood and inner tension may translate to better emotional stability.  

**Bipolar Disorder:** Bipolar mood disorder involves episodic mood swings, so findings here are relevant. Chengappa et al. (2013) conducted an 8-week randomized trial in 60 euthymic bipolar patients, using ashwagandha 500 mg/day adjunctively to maintenance medication ([Randomized placebo-controlled adjunctive study of an extract of withania somnifera for cognitive dysfunction in bipolar disorder - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24330893/#:~:text=Method%3A%20%20Sixty%20euthymic%20subjects,were%20monitored%20at%20scheduled%20visits)). While the primary aim was to improve cognitive function, they reported that **mood and anxiety symptoms remained stable and did not worsen** with ashwagandha ([Randomized placebo-controlled adjunctive study of an extract of withania somnifera for cognitive dysfunction in bipolar disorder - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24330893/#:~:text=of%20the%20other%20cognitive%20tasks,and%20adverse%20events%20were%20minor)). In other words, ashwagandha did not destabilize mood, and patients showed improved working memory and social cognition versus placebo. Another trial by Lopresti et al. (2019) (mixed patient population including some with bipolar-anxiety features) noted that ashwagandha produced **anxiolytic effects** and was “safe and well-tolerated” ([
            Effects of Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) on Stress and the Stress-Related Neuropsychiatric Disorders Anxiety, Depression, and Insomnia - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8762185/#:~:text=6%20weeks%20Placebo%2039%20adults,64)) ([Plant-derived nootropics and human cognition: A systematic review](https://openaccess.uoc.edu/bitstream/10609/146528/1/Plant%20derived%20nootropics%20and%20human%20cognition%20A%20systematic%20review.pdf#:~:text=patients%20with%20a%20dose%20of,Lopresti%20et%C2%A0%20al)). Although bipolar trials haven’t directly measured “mood lability” per se, these studies hint that ashwagandha might help **buffer stress and anxiety without exacerbating mood swings**. This is an important safety consideration if ashwagandha were to be used in BPD patients who are sensitive to medication-induced mood shifts.  

**Schizophrenia (Adjunct Treatment):** Emotional dysregulation can also occur in acute schizophrenia exacerbations. A 12-week RCT in patients with schizophrenia experiencing symptom worsening tested ashwagandha (W. somnifera extract 1000 mg/day) vs placebo (Chengappa et al. 2018). Results from a secondary analysis by Gannon et al. (2019) showed **medium-effect-size improvements in depression and anxiety symptoms** in the ashwagandha group compared to placebo ([Effects of a standardized extract of Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) on depression and anxiety symptoms in persons with schizophrenia participating in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31046033/#:~:text=Results%3A%20%20Medium%20effect%20sizes,events%20were%20mild%20and%20transient)). While schizophrenia is distinct from BPD, this trial demonstrates ashwagandha’s capacity to improve mood-related symptoms (depressed and anxious mood) in a clinical population, further supporting its stabilizing, adaptogenic effects on affect. The treatment was well tolerated with only mild, transient side effects ([Effects of a standardized extract of Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) on depression and anxiety symptoms in persons with schizophrenia participating in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31046033/#:~:text=Results%3A%20%20Medium%20effect%20sizes,events%20were%20mild%20and%20transient)).  

**Systematic Reviews and Guidelines:** Broad reviews of herbal treatments also highlight ashwagandha’s potential in mood modulation. A 2021 systematic review by Lopresti & Smith examined human trials of ashwagandha across various conditions and noted **significant anxiolytic and stress-relieving benefits in most studies**, though it called for larger trials in specific disorders ([Plant-derived nootropics and human cognition: A systematic review](https://openaccess.uoc.edu/bitstream/10609/146528/1/Plant%20derived%20nootropics%20and%20human%20cognition%20A%20systematic%20review.pdf#:~:text=Ashwagandha%20Multiple%20human%20trials%20have,influential%20in%20this%20systematic%20review)) ([(PDF) An Alternative Treatment for Anxiety: A Systematic Review of ...](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268795467_An_Alternative_Treatment_for_Anxiety_A_Systematic_Review_of_Human_Trial_Results_Reported_for_the_Ayurvedic_Herb_Ashwagandha_Withania_somnifera#:~:text=All%20five%20studies%20concluded%20that,outcomes%20on%20anxiety%20or)). Similarly, an international taskforce (WFSBP/CANMAT 2022) on nutraceuticals in psychiatry gave a preliminary positive note to ashwagandha for anxiety due to emerging evidence ([

](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Ashwagandha-HealthProfessional/#:~:text=Results%20from%20several%20clinical%20trials,varied%20from%20240%20to%201%2C250)) ([

](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Ashwagandha-HealthProfessional/#:~:text=match%20at%20L439%2018,CANMAT%29%20Taskforce)). That said, none of the existing reviews focus on personality disorders specifically, underscoring a gap in research. 

In summary, **ashwagandha (≥300 mg/day) has shown clinically significant reductions in stress, anxiety, and secondary depressive symptoms in multiple RCTs** ([A prospective, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study of safety and efficacy of a high-concentration full-spectrum extract of ashwagandha root in reducing stress and anxiety in adults - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23439798/#:~:text=Results%3A%20%20The%20treatment%20group,0006%29%20in%20the)) ([Effects of a standardized extract of Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) on depression and anxiety symptoms in persons with schizophrenia participating in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31046033/#:~:text=Results%3A%20%20Medium%20effect%20sizes,events%20were%20mild%20and%20transient)). These effects suggest it may help reduce the intensity of mood swings and improve emotional resilience. Patients with mood lability may experience fewer extreme reactions to stressors when on ashwagandha, according to the trends seen in trials. However, **direct evidence in BPD is lacking**. The existing studies provide a rationale for investigating ashwagandha in BPD, but robust clinical trials in that population are needed.

# Conclusion  
In conclusion, while **direct clinical trial evidence for ashwagandha in BPD or personality-disorder-related mood lability is sparse**, related research suggests potential benefits. Ashwagandha at doses ≥300 mg/day has been shown in multiple RCTs to **reduce stress, anxiety, and secondary mood symptoms** in various populations ([A prospective, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study of safety and efficacy of a high-concentration full-spectrum extract of ashwagandha root in reducing stress and anxiety in adults - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23439798/#:~:text=Results%3A%20%20The%20treatment%20group,0006%29%20in%20the)) ([Effects of a standardized extract of Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) on depression and anxiety symptoms in persons with schizophrenia participating in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31046033/#:~:text=Results%3A%20%20Medium%20effect%20sizes,events%20were%20mild%20and%20transient)). These effects could translate into smoother mood regulation and fewer extreme emotional swings for individuals prone to mood lability. Importantly, the available trials (including those in bipolar patients) indicate that ashwagandha is well-tolerated and does not *worsen* mood instability ([Randomized placebo-controlled adjunctive study of an extract of withania somnifera for cognitive dysfunction in bipolar disorder - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24330893/#:~:text=of%20the%20other%20cognitive%20tasks,and%20adverse%20events%20were%20minor)). This safety profile is encouraging for use in emotionally volatile conditions. 

However, it must be emphasized that **BPD-specific data are lacking** – we are extrapolating from related conditions. BPD’s mood lability is complex, and no herbal supplement can replace targeted psychotherapy or, when needed, pharmacotherapy. Ashwagandha may serve as a complementary approach to help with underlying anxiety and stress that fuel emotional dysregulation. Given the promising findings in anxiety and stress disorders, **future research should directly evaluate ashwagandha in BPD or chronic mood instability**, using robust designs (e.g. placebo-controlled trials) and relevant outcomes (frequency/intensity of mood swings, impulsivity, etc.). Until then, clinicians and patients should remain cautious. 

In summary, ashwagandha appears to **safely reduce stress and anxiety** – factors closely tied to mood swings – and thus may offer some stabilizing benefits for mood lability. Current evidence from clinical trials and reviews supports its anxiolytic and adaptogenic effects, but **dedicated studies in personality disorders are needed** to confirm efficacy for BPD mood dysregulation. All management decisions should be individualized and based on clinical judgment, with ashwagandha viewed as a potential adjunctive tool rather than a standalone solution for borderline personality disorder’s complex mood symptoms.

27/02/2025, 22:13 - Vita: yeah its quite heavy so staying there for awhile, but would prefer not to have massive fecking bruises on my hips for the forseeable future😅
27/02/2025, 22:14 - Vita: (only acceptable bruises in this area are love bites from you hehe)
27/02/2025, 22:15 - Vita: amazing! bc i wanna make that lime salsa thats really good with steak again, and mayybe a bearnaise peppercorn sauce
27/02/2025, 22:15 - Vita: if you have much experience cooking steaks help is appreciated - i feel like you know your way around a grill {huge honour and compliment btw}

28/02/2025, 02:30 - Tim Farrelly: I'm going to have a quick look at redesigning my website again now
28/02/2025, 02:31 - Tim Farrelly: I have a meeting at 11am tmrw, so I'll likely just set up some boilerplate for the main redesign - I got some James Turrell like stuff done last night, but I need to sit down with a specific photo/ short clip of some of his work, and just replicate it I think, and then find my own colourway for it
28/02/2025, 02:32 - Tim Farrelly: many "hehe's" up above
28/02/2025, 02:32 - Tim Farrelly: still smiling haha

28/02/2025, 02:32 - Tim Farrelly: My Gordon Ramsay era is still latent within me you'll be glad to hear
28/02/2025, 02:33 - Tim Farrelly: the knowing how to cook a steak part, rather than the idiot sandwich part lol

28/02/2025, 22:02 - Vita: first and last bit are probably the most important to me anyway but lmk if you wanna add anything to the list!
28/02/2025, 22:04 - Vita: oh and also forgot to add (but incredibly important and just remembered to say) that i am not *at all* into being cucked so just watching or holding your hand will not be the vibe for me hahaha
28/02/2025, 22:04 - Vita: I know this isnt imminent but thought i’d have a think while i’ve a bit of time hahaha
28/02/2025, 23:01 - Vita: but also upon further thought, (and I’ll see how I feel closer to the time ofc bc this could well change), but if I’m being *completely* honest, the summertime might be a bit before I’m ready, just I think especially on the background of the stuff going on over the past few weeks and how I’ve been feeling
28/02/2025, 23:04 - Tim Farrelly: Nawww darnit

03/03/2025, 08:50 - Vita: yeah I was thinking this and I feel you’re the kinda person who needs hard data to implement change
03/03/2025, 08:50 - Vita: so i think the whoop could actually be veryyy handy
03/03/2025, 13:14 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
03/03/2025, 13:14 - Tim Farrelly: Oops
03/03/2025, 13:14 - Tim Farrelly: Meant to be send once
03/03/2025, 13:15 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
03/03/2025, 13:16 - Tim Farrelly: You actually look sculpted
03/03/2025, 13:16 - Tim Farrelly: Maybe even AI generated
03/03/2025, 13:16 - Tim Farrelly: 👀👀
03/03/2025, 13:16 - Tim Farrelly: It was yeah! But should have done more of my thesis + FOV work! But yeah, got most of my patch work for this week done I guess hahah
03/03/2025, 13:17 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah I think so! Something for me to see
03/03/2025, 13:19 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
03/03/2025, 13:19 - Tim Farrelly: Show me what you end up wearing for graduation!
03/03/2025, 14:53 - Vita: good afternoon:)
03/03/2025, 14:53 - Vita: just strolling home from ucd now!
03/03/2025, 14:54 - Vita: my favourite face to see after sending a nude;)
03/03/2025, 14:54 - Vita: hehehehe stoppp
03/03/2025, 14:54 - Vita: the future is now i guess👀 ai gf time
03/03/2025, 14:55 - Vita: enjoy the run tho! the weather is perfecttt for it omg
03/03/2025, 14:56 - Vita: okay but loving this new life re-do you’re up to atm, i impatiently await the outcome of each change to see if i might implement it myself lol
03/03/2025, 14:57 - Vita: like the app that you’ve to walk across your room to open your phone sounds quite handy
03/03/2025, 14:57 - Vita: tbf for me i think the biggest killer of braincells was defo instagram
03/03/2025, 14:57 - Vita: so provided i can stay off it for awhile i should be good
03/03/2025, 14:57 - Vita: but these are all tempting options
03/03/2025, 14:58 - Vita: aw unreal:) im sure you’ll be super productive today after your run as well!
03/03/2025, 14:58 - Vita: im slightly tight on time today since im meeting the girls for dinner later to welcome emma back, but think it’ll be super lovely:) location tbc but will let ya know where we end up hehe
03/03/2025, 14:59 - Vita: yeah the subscription on the rings is a realll killer - I think when it comes to the time I’m buying one I’d probs have a look to see if I could get a second hand one to save on device cost, otherwise I’d consider getting a superhuman ring as opposed to oura, since that’s a one off payment
03/03/2025, 14:59 - Vita: issue is tho i think ouras data is better and more accurate
03/03/2025, 15:00 - Vita: but theyre kinda my only option since i wouldnt be able to wear a fitbit or whatever at work!
03/03/2025, 15:00 - Tim Farrelly: Send a photo of your outfit!
03/03/2025, 15:00 - Tim Farrelly: So fair!
03/03/2025, 15:00 - Vita: i’m just about to get on the bus but will when I’m home! since it was just a headshot i’m wearing my black casual lowcut dress:)
03/03/2025, 15:00 - Tim Farrelly: I mean, health is a small price to pay for, as long as there's even marginal improvements
03/03/2025, 15:01 - Vita: the pic was okay, unfortunately my hair was sitting funny in it but we only got one go - not the worst tho all the same😅
03/03/2025, 15:01 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah it seems oura + apple watch 10 are the best
03/03/2025, 15:01 - Tim Farrelly: The Quantified Scientist is the person to watch on YouTube for this
03/03/2025, 15:02 - Vita: this is my thoughts…. ngl since i’ll be earning and not paying rent next year it might be worth it
03/03/2025, 15:02 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
03/03/2025, 15:03 - Vita: I will absolutely be tucking this away for when I’m getting one
03/03/2025, 15:03 - Vita: I think I read an article by him earlier actually!
03/03/2025, 15:03 - Vita: with the EEG stuff hehe
03/03/2025, 15:04 - Vita: I’d say the whoop would be a good intro for you though since its no strings
03/03/2025, 15:04 - Vita: and would most likely be of great benefit even if you returned it after a week just vis à vis getting insights into your sleeping pattern and where to improve that
03/03/2025, 15:04 - Vita: ahahahahah
03/03/2025, 15:05 - Vita: is it a tim vm without there being a toilet break involved…?💀
03/03/2025, 15:20 - Vita: <Media omitted>
03/03/2025, 15:20 - Vita: This message was deleted

03/03/2025, 18:07 - Vita: young boys🤤
03/03/2025, 18:23 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
03/03/2025, 18:23 - Tim Farrelly: Otw!
03/03/2025, 18:24 - Tim Farrelly: Text in a bit but hope you enjoy dinner with the girlies
03/03/2025, 18:24 - Vita: yay!
03/03/2025, 18:24 - Vita: i wonder what it’ll do when we have sex lol
03/03/2025, 18:24 - Vita: merciiii im so excited to see emma!
03/03/2025, 18:28 - Tim Farrelly: hahaha that'll actually be very cool to see
03/03/2025, 18:28 - Tim Farrelly: heart rate will be off the chart I can only assum e
03/03/2025, 22:52 - Tim Farrelly: Good evening:)
03/03/2025, 22:52 - Tim Farrelly: How was your dinner!?
03/03/2025, 22:53 - Tim Farrelly: Aww class!
03/03/2025, 22:53 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah exactly! It's 244 a year afterwards, or 30 a month, which really isn't great though:/
03/03/2025, 22:54 - Tim Farrelly: Will do a good look at the different options at that point. The ring could be cheaper assuming years of use
03/03/2025, 22:54 - Tim Farrelly: Or otherwise, just the fit bit!
03/03/2025, 22:54 - Tim Farrelly: Hahahahaha
03/03/2025, 22:54 - Tim Farrelly: My signature move
03/03/2025, 22:54 - Tim Farrelly: You look particularly lovely there:)
03/03/2025, 22:55 - Tim Farrelly: Hahahaha now I need to see it!!
03/03/2025, 22:55 - Tim Farrelly: Pi?
03/03/2025, 22:55 - Tim Farrelly: The empirical approach here is best ofc
03/03/2025, 23:51 - Vita: hello! I’m just waiting on the bus now:)
03/03/2025, 23:51 - Vita: dinner was great! we met at 8 and had a very wonderful and needed catchup:)
03/03/2025, 23:51 - Vita: I had a nduja pizza which was ideal hehe but no hot honey:(

04/03/2025, 00:01 - Vita: <Media omitted>
04/03/2025, 00:02 - Vita: sorry got distracted at the end bc there was a man stumbling about on the road ahead of me and i was trying to avoid him💀
04/03/2025, 00:02 - Vita: he was g just tipsy i think lol
04/03/2025, 00:21 - Vita: off to bed now anyway, night tim:) xx
04/03/2025, 00:37 - Tim Farrelly: ah a bit too hard on the _H&M_ if you don't mind me saying so;)
04/03/2025, 00:37 - Tim Farrelly: a little more Balenciaga is all ya need
04/03/2025, 00:37 - Tim Farrelly: ah fantastic!
04/03/2025, 00:49 - Tim Farrelly: hope Aoife is able to focus anyways :)
04/03/2025, 00:50 - Tim Farrelly: does she have a house down there? I think I remember you saying one of your friends did
04/03/2025, 00:50 - Tim Farrelly: but yeah, glad to hear it was a lovely evening! staying till closing is a very good vibe
04/03/2025, 00:50 - Tim Farrelly: I've been relatively productive:) Tryna make an app for FOV which is a relatively new thing for me, but Claude is beasting through it
04/03/2025, 00:51 - Tim Farrelly: Would love to join you at the pub quiz sometime soon! Likely not tmrw with run club + plan to make a bit of a social visit to the course room, but would really like to sometime soon!
04/03/2025, 01:28 - Tim Farrelly: interestingly, ive found myself open my phone multiple times trying to find Instagram, just to procrastinate before remembering that I deleted it lol
04/03/2025, 04:14 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
04/03/2025, 09:12 - Vita: hahahaha very fair

04/03/2025, 13:56 - Tim Farrelly: Very very :-(
04/03/2025, 13:56 - Tim Farrelly: Haha that was text to speech
04/03/2025, 13:57 - Tim Farrelly: Still no yogurt!
04/03/2025, 14:05 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
04/03/2025, 14:05 - Tim Farrelly: How long do you spend searching for histories like what is the average history per hour ratio
04/03/2025, 14:08 - Vita: ooooh very niceee im glad you’re out enjoying the weather:)
04/03/2025, 14:09 - Vita: im just home, had a quick bite to eat and some study - gonna take a very quick nap now:)
04/03/2025, 14:10 - Vita: hmmm tbh it takes like 15-20 to find one and then taking one in full takes about 40 mins, so youre looking at an hour per history on a good day provided there’s no major intervening factors
04/03/2025, 14:10 - Vita: awww very sad you’ve to have the worse yoghurt
04/03/2025, 14:10 - Vita: dick suck soon i promise xxxx
04/03/2025, 15:02 - Tim Farrelly: Oh jeez !! How does that take 40 mins!
04/03/2025, 15:02 - Tim Farrelly: That's 40 mins of talking to them!?
04/03/2025, 15:03 - Tim Farrelly: Tell me more when we see each other I guess hahah
04/03/2025, 15:03 - Tim Farrelly: No yoghurt🥺 👉👈
04/03/2025, 15:04 - Tim Farrelly: Me thinks I'm gonna get a sprout now!
04/03/2025, 16:55 - Vita: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2025/03/04/doctor-with-drug-addiction-pleads-guilty-to-forgery-and-stealing-prescriptions/
04/03/2025, 16:55 - Vita: omg this was one of my tutors💀💀💀💀💀
04/03/2025, 16:55 - Vita: crikeyyy
04/03/2025, 16:57 - Vita: hahhaa i’ll give you a full rundown when i see you but tbf its actually not that long when you consider in 40 mins i need to get
- history of presenting complaint
- ⁠full medical and surgical history
- ⁠allergies and medications history
- ⁠family history
- ⁠social history
- ⁠review of systems
- ⁠complete relevant physical exam 
in that time ahahha
04/03/2025, 16:57 - Vita: and like people do be having mad shit wrong with them lmao
04/03/2025, 16:57 - Vita: awwwww🥺🥺🥺
04/03/2025, 16:57 - Vita: defo do!
04/03/2025, 16:57 - Vita: i had a rather unproductive study day so far, heading to the gym for an anki x lifting sesh lol
04/03/2025, 20:31 - Tim Farrelly: How do you steal prescriptions lol?
04/03/2025, 20:31 - Tim Farrelly: I assumed you can just prescribe yourself stuff?
04/03/2025, 20:31 - Tim Farrelly: Excuse my ignorance here
04/03/2025, 20:31 - Tim Farrelly: Yikes tho hahah

04/03/2025, 20:34 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
04/03/2025, 21:30 - Vita: not allowed sadly:(
04/03/2025, 21:31 - Vita: which is so rude of the medical council fr
04/03/2025, 21:31 - Vita: the doctors yearn for boundless ritalin‼️
04/03/2025, 21:32 - Vita: yeah not to be such a bleeding heart psychiatrist about it but i actually think its poor form for the irish times to report on it? like addiction is a genuine illness and people who’d be dismissed as ‘junkies’ steal prescriptions all the time without reputational damage because they’re not white collar
04/03/2025, 21:33 - Vita: now should they be taking away his prescription pad…? yes ofc, but he’s only hurting himself in his actions
04/03/2025, 21:35 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah no I kind of just feel bad for him
04/03/2025, 21:35 - Tim Farrelly: The Irish times can be quite immoral
04/03/2025, 21:35 - Vita: instagram mentioned….👀 did you cave and redownload? lol
04/03/2025, 23:27 - Vita: off to bed now anyway, night night tim:) was lovely to chat earlier! hope you’re having a v productive evening hehe

06/03/2025, 01:44 - Tim Farrelly: but yeah, I think what would be good for me to do is work from the library for a bit, and just have myself dedicated a couple hours a day to it over the next week, and just not work on anything else
06/03/2025, 01:44 - Tim Farrelly: as simple as that sounds hahah
06/03/2025, 01:45 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
06/03/2025, 02:03 - Tim Farrelly: Also... would you fancy writing the sexy survey with me and ChatGPT? I think I should aim to start doing that this week before we're back from reading week, there's only 6 weeks of college left thereafter, and not sure if the college newspapers will be publishing much more!!
06/03/2025, 02:04 - Tim Farrelly: So its gametime
06/03/2025, 02:38 - Tim Farrelly: Update: I've started it lol while procrasting AFL stuff lol
06/03/2025, 02:38 - Tim Farrelly: I need your best wit tomorrow to write an opening for the survey and good funny questions that would help encourage people to share it with their friends
06/03/2025, 02:38 - Tim Farrelly: And the poster/ copy we use for sharing it ofc
06/03/2025, 02:40 - Tim Farrelly: Prize draw (optional, wouldn't be anonymous/ would have to include email/ phone number) to help encourage... €20 one for all voucher or 100 condoms?
06/03/2025, 02:40 - Tim Farrelly: I'd have more than that lying around lol
06/03/2025, 02:40 - Tim Farrelly: rather... lmao*
06/03/2025, 02:40 - Tim Farrelly: not to flex
06/03/2025, 02:41 - Tim Farrelly: (bought 100 condoms once and didn't like them/ first couple broke)
06/03/2025, 02:44 - Tim Farrelly: Perhaps... also a date where we could put up posters across campus?? Will need your help to post it inside some toilet bathroom stall doors (Excellent place for this sort of thing lmao - genuinely)
06/03/2025, 02:44 - Tim Farrelly: hot choccy + pastry on me ofc;)
06/03/2025, 04:07 - Tim Farrelly: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4772188/

06/03/2025, 07:06 - Tim Farrelly: Hey, ended up pulling a bit of an all nightery working on the AFL AI stuff... got a lot done anwyays, but its not really working yet but ah sure. 

I'll get another solid nap during the day today anyways.

Was going to say... what might be nice to do is for us to have some more study dates? Could be good accountability for us to focus on whatever we want to work on... if that's AFL AI or James Turrell for me, or whatever for you
06/03/2025, 10:01 - Vita: good morning!

06/03/2025, 10:02 - Vita: i probs got to sleep closer to 11:30, but got plenty of it - which is good bc i dont think its of the best quality atm, i’ll likely have to increase the amount im sleeping overall
06/03/2025, 10:03 - Vita: ah I know but sometimes it really is just all about stripping it back to basics!
06/03/2025, 10:04 - Vita: HAHAHAHA

06/03/2025, 16:22 - Tim Farrelly: Fyi kinara has a much more limited menu than in person in clontarf at least! But they still have butter chicken on it at least lol
06/03/2025, 16:22 - Tim Farrelly: Ahh let me think, 1 min lol
06/03/2025, 16:23 - Vita: theyd want to have butter chicken being in that neighbourhood lmaoo

07/03/2025, 19:22 - Vita: <Media omitted>

08/03/2025, 00:16 - Tim Farrelly: And no, ended up giving it a skip, and having a very chill night
08/03/2025, 00:16 - Tim Farrelly: Doing FOV work atm/ helping Omar debug something, we are at the aviva game tmrw

08/03/2025, 00:17 - Tim Farrelly: Otherwise, very chill:) Had a light leg session in the gym earlier, and setting up the whoop and such
08/03/2025, 00:17 - Tim Farrelly: It seems it takes a few days for the whoop to calibrate itself, and somewhat annoyingly, it doesn't really let you see your live figures (i.e. bpm, etc.) in a clear way till then
08/03/2025, 00:26 - Vita: hello! just heading to bed now:)
08/03/2025, 00:26 - Vita: hope the rest of your night is productive!
08/03/2025, 00:27 - Vita: ah very good, sounds like a shout anyway:)
08/03/2025, 00:28 - Vita: ah thats a pity! how long is the trial again? 7 days…?
08/03/2025, 00:28 - Vita: but hopefully it’ll adjust to you quickly ;)

08/03/2025, 12:44 - Tim Farrelly: It's very accurate! I woke up at 9.40 but then fell back to sleep tho haha
08/03/2025, 12:45 - Tim Farrelly: It's interesting to see the heart spikes back to back when I woke up at 9.40, I wonder what the earlier spikes are from when I was asleep
08/03/2025, 12:46 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
08/03/2025, 12:46 - Tim Farrelly: It tracks sleep debt haha!

08/03/2025, 13:37 - Vita: ahahaha hoping on your account that it all goes nice and smoothly so :,)
08/03/2025, 13:37 - Vita: yeah its gonna have to be a run, its absolutely stunning out
08/03/2025, 13:38 - Vita: im gonna grab some tacos for lunch i think since i feel like treating myself, then go for a run in an hour or two hehe
08/03/2025, 13:38 - Vita: ah this is wonderful to hear!
08/03/2025, 13:39 - Vita: night time erections perhaps?? xxx
08/03/2025, 13:40 - Vita: kidding but i imagine it’d have something to do with if youre in rem?
08/03/2025, 18:58 - Tim Farrelly: Or you could just get the ring now!

12/03/2025, 12:29 - Tim Farrelly: Is it just me or is there a weird sort of shelf on the front...
12/03/2025, 12:29 - Tim Farrelly: Had asked to keep the length too, just thin it out and neaten up the edges
12/03/2025, 12:34 - Vita: tim this is genuinely so funny
12/03/2025, 12:34 - Vita: <Media omitted>
12/03/2025, 12:34 - Vita: thought it looked familiar
12/03/2025, 12:35 - Vita: the shelf in particular is very hitler youth X
12/03/2025, 12:36 - Vita: (more so the faces you’re pulling in the photos as to the haircut itself bahahaha the discontent is palpable)
12/03/2025, 12:36 - Vita: im sorry but they did you dirty
12/03/2025, 12:36 - Vita: booked for 8:30 saturday, plenty of time for a little bit of anal beforehand;)
12/03/2025, 12:36 - Vita: ah merci:)
12/03/2025, 12:43 - Tim Farrelly: I might actually try wake up early and go to the other Grafton barbers to see if they can fix it lmao
12/03/2025, 12:43 - Tim Farrelly: It's soo bad aghhh
12/03/2025, 12:45 - Vita: awww my front facing camera isnt working :((
12/03/2025, 12:45 - Vita: so i cant pick up
12/03/2025, 12:45 - Vita: but send me a video xx
12/03/2025, 12:45 - Vita: i would normally be one to tell you that its fine but genuinely tim that is a horrific haircut i cant even sugarcoat it ahahhaha
12/03/2025, 12:46 - Vita: quite funny but a huge pain you’ll have to get it fixed
12/03/2025, 12:46 - Vita: would you ask for a refund?
12/03/2025, 12:46 - Vita: like its at that level i’d wager
12/03/2025, 12:49 - Vita: https://youtu.be/4aCqLqlAuTo?si=fDe1nZm77uHb-vei
12/03/2025, 12:51 - Vita: reminded me of this scene from fleabag ahahha
12/03/2025, 13:02 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah I just sent an email there to grafton barber asking for them to refund this 2nd haircut I'm going to get lol
12/03/2025, 13:02 - Tim Farrelly: I'm heading to the location where I got a good haircut the last time
12/03/2025, 13:02 - Tim Farrelly: I don't think they can do much in store tbh, especially if I go to a separate location
12/03/2025, 13:03 - Tim Farrelly: Might ask for them to refund both, as that's pretty horrific
12/03/2025, 13:03 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
12/03/2025, 13:04 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
12/03/2025, 13:04 - Tim Farrelly: Vs the one I got the last time !
12/03/2025, 13:04 - Tim Farrelly: You also can't see how short my sides are right now, I was trying to keep length lol
12/03/2025, 13:04 - Tim Farrelly: Main thing is just the time honestly
12/03/2025, 13:04 - Tim Farrelly: But ah well
12/03/2025, 13:43 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
12/03/2025, 13:43 - Tim Farrelly: oh jesus christ thats the rave lmao
12/03/2025, 13:43 - Tim Farrelly: I won't be able to make it this Friday if that's then
12/03/2025, 13:43 - Tim Farrelly: And... not sure if ill make it in general... I don't think I can handle an all nighter atm
12/03/2025, 14:03 - Vita: I think you absolutely, absolutely should
12/03/2025, 14:03 - Vita: let me know what they say!
12/03/2025, 14:03 - Vita: and what the outcome was going to the other place - if they fix it!
12/03/2025, 14:04 - Tim Farrelly: they just emailed back to say they'll give the 2nd one free - the head office will just ring the south anne street barber
12/03/2025, 14:04 - Vita: not really the time or place but god your jaw is chiselled lmao
12/03/2025, 14:04 - Tim Farrelly: had to send them a couple photos of it

12/03/2025, 14:04 - Vita: tim im cackling your face says it all
12/03/2025, 14:04 - Tim Farrelly: It's mainly just the weird overhang
12/03/2025, 14:05 - Tim Farrelly: lol
12/03/2025, 14:05 - Vita: the disgust is beyond palpable
12/03/2025, 14:05 - Tim Farrelly: hahahaha
12/03/2025, 14:05 - Tim Farrelly: I said in the email, "if you'll excuse my face" hahah
12/03/2025, 14:05 - Vita: the overhang is just so unbelievably hitler i cant believe they did you like that💀
12/03/2025, 14:05 - Tim Farrelly: does it look as bad as I feel it is
12/03/2025, 14:05 - Tim Farrelly: even when I try to smooth it out like here
12/03/2025, 14:06 - Vita: tbf this isnt so bad but yeah its a pretty terrible haircut

12/03/2025, 14:07 - Tim Farrelly: i meant in that particular last pic haha!
12/03/2025, 14:07 - Vita: and even then i’d have needed significant chemical enhancements

13/03/2025, 16:20 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
13/03/2025, 16:20 - Tim Farrelly: Just got this all set up!
13/03/2025, 16:21 - Tim Farrelly: Arrived basically a week ahead of when it said it'd arrive hehe
13/03/2025, 16:21 - Tim Farrelly: Very glad that the silver was out of stock, and I could get this brushed version, is a lot more _me_
13/03/2025, 16:22 - Tim Farrelly: "*bearish* on cycling in Dublin"
13/03/2025, 16:22 - Tim Farrelly: Ayyyyyy
13/03/2025, 16:23 - Tim Farrelly: 📉🚲... 🥺
13/03/2025, 17:08 - Vita: ah huge win all the same! that’ll be so good for ya ;) i’ll be stealing when i visit btw hehe
13/03/2025, 17:09 - Vita: so so fair, i’ve been the same… though the anki in bed did hit the spot. time to get up now tho :,)
13/03/2025, 17:09 - Vita: very very very nice! how long does it take to calibrate?
13/03/2025, 17:09 - Vita: it looks lovely anyway, the brushed silver was defo the play:€
13/03/2025, 17:09 - Vita: *:)
13/03/2025, 17:10 - Vita: :( fr tho :((
13/03/2025, 17:11 - Vita: this looks great though, and not too chunky! i thought it’d look bulkier tbh
13/03/2025, 17:25 - Tim Farrelly: ofc!
13/03/2025, 17:25 - Tim Farrelly: calibrated immediately at least for giving me heart rate and stuff!
13/03/2025, 17:26 - Tim Farrelly: I know! Very happy with it - I think I'll most likely stick with the ring as opposed to the whoop. Slightly better sleep tracking, and cheaper in the long run (assuming I'll have it and use it for over a year)
13/03/2025, 19:42 - Vita: amazing! even including with the monthly subscription?
13/03/2025, 19:42 - Vita: also at drawing rn text later:)

13/03/2025, 23:38 - Tim Farrelly: I really hope Grimes isn't fucking around

13/03/2025, 23:38 - Vita: im so excited for zakura tim its not even funny
13/03/2025, 23:38 - Vita: no pleaseeeeee
13/03/2025, 23:38 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah, I still think Elon was one of the most impactful (in a good way!) humans, but idk if he's suffering from Nobel disease
13/03/2025, 23:39 - Tim Farrelly: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_effect#:~:text=Nobel%20disease%20is%20a%20hypothesized,ideas%2C%20usually%20later%20in%20life.
13/03/2025, 23:39 - Vita: I think if he continues this trajectory (despite the obvious reputational damage), he’s likely to  do a lot of impactful bad stuff lol
13/03/2025, 23:39 - Vita: net neutral by death perhaps?
13/03/2025, 23:40 - Vita: ahahaha i’ve read about this before
13/03/2025, 23:40 - Tim Farrelly: Like what?
13/03/2025, 23:40 - Tim Farrelly: American policy stuff?
13/03/2025, 23:40 - Vita: this was my line of thinking yes
13/03/2025, 23:40 - Tim Farrelly: Hahahah no I think Tesla + SpaceX really far outpace a lot of things honestly
13/03/2025, 23:41 - Tim Farrelly: Literally started both industries when others didn't think it was possible
13/03/2025, 23:41 - Tim Farrelly: (SpaceX being impactful in the scenario of being a crucial step to becoming interplanetary down the line)
13/03/2025, 23:42 - Tim Farrelly: And plenty of other things too there actually, like bringing internet to impoverished nations via starlink... Or at least being able to, and more. But yeah, he needs to chill
13/03/2025, 23:43 - Vita: which is dropping first would you reckon luigis tape or elons?
13/03/2025, 23:43 - Vita: most certainly agree on the last bit, as you know I’m bearish on an interplanetary existance ahaha
13/03/2025, 23:44 - Vita: but all the same as I say I sincerely hope its only reputational damage he’s doing to himself
13/03/2025, 23:44 - Tim Farrelly: Hahahahahaha
13/03/2025, 23:44 - Tim Farrelly: Real question
13/03/2025, 23:44 - Vita: in *entirely* unrelated news anyway my sexy new lace top should be here tomorrow🤩

14/03/2025, 14:29 - Tim Farrelly: I was up late last night not really doing anything, mostly just ruminating
14/03/2025, 14:30 - Tim Farrelly: lied down in bed after we had texted, and I started watching succession at some point. After a couple episodes, I just read through the whole plot synopsis so I wouldn't go back to watching more of it (was good, but not great, but its an easy thing to watch and know there's other things I'd prefer if I was to think a bit more lol)
14/03/2025, 14:31 - Tim Farrelly: And then stayed up ruminating about FOV + what the next few months to years might look like + life lol
14/03/2025, 14:31 - Tim Farrelly: :)
14/03/2025, 14:32 - Tim Farrelly: but anyways - not getting out for a walk yet - I need to send on some slides for the thesis presentation to my supervisor by 4pm so he can give some feedback:)

14/03/2025, 14:34 - Tim Farrelly: you know there's times when I almost say this in person now when talking to someone, and have to remind myself not too
14/03/2025, 14:34 - Tim Farrelly: like last night I brought up zaha Hadid to someone

14/03/2025, 14:36 - Tim Farrelly: think ill actually get out for a quick walk and call trish - I think we should start looking at booking things for Italy if we can get out there in late April
14/03/2025, 14:36 - Tim Farrelly: hahaha certainly not a 5 year plan - closer to 1 year
14/03/2025, 14:36 - Tim Farrelly: we can chat about it tmrw

15/03/2025, 23:41 - Tim Farrelly: Oh
15/03/2025, 23:41 - Vita: yeah not fucking cool
16/03/2025, 00:10 - Vita: off to bed now, night tim xx
16/03/2025, 00:14 - Tim Farrelly: Hope you sleep well :)
16/03/2025, 00:14 - Tim Farrelly: Goodnight xx
16/03/2025, 13:02 - Tim Farrelly: Hey good morning
16/03/2025, 13:02 - Tim Farrelly: Ended up not getting to sleep so early after all haha
16/03/2025, 13:03 - Tim Farrelly: Kinda just rotted watching YouTube for a while - I think I've gotten that out of my system anyways
16/03/2025, 13:04 - Tim Farrelly: Fyi, the girl left the message on read, and I've just archived the chat
16/03/2025, 13:05 - Tim Farrelly: How's studying going?
16/03/2025, 14:41 - Vita: thought you were gonna block her?
16/03/2025, 14:41 - Vita: its been fine, really not feeling great today but it is what it is
16/03/2025, 14:41 - Vita: getting through the work in any case
16/03/2025, 14:42 - Vita: I think this is going to take me a good few days to get over tbh
16/03/2025, 14:42 - Vita: what does the oura say anyway haha
16/03/2025, 14:45 - Tim Farrelly: Shall block her now. I had archived her last night tbh as I just didn't want to see it when I opened WhatsApp, before I saw she'd read it this morning
16/03/2025, 14:47 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah that's understandable, thanks for letting me know, I'm glad to hear you're getting through work regardless
16/03/2025, 14:51 - Tim Farrelly: My mood is a bit low too tbh - I think partly why I was rotting in bed lol
16/03/2025, 14:54 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
16/03/2025, 14:54 - Tim Farrelly: Quite accurate haha, very accurate on when I actually got out of bed/ woke up
16/03/2025, 14:54 - Tim Farrelly: The interface on the whoop is definitely much better, but this is quite accurate at least
16/03/2025, 14:55 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
16/03/2025, 14:55 - Tim Farrelly: Not too much rem sleep, but otherwise, good
16/03/2025, 14:56 - Tim Farrelly: But anyways, I'm going out for a quick run now, it's beautiful out, and then a quick gym workout, and then heading home to see the fam!
16/03/2025, 14:56 - Tim Farrelly: Ps, I'm on the toilet;)
16/03/2025, 15:04 - Tim Farrelly: Ah, any chance you still have my Trinity card, or do you remember giving it back to me?
16/03/2025, 15:19 - Vita: fuck i just checked and i actually do have it
16/03/2025, 15:19 - Vita: do you need it today or can i give to you tomorrow
16/03/2025, 15:19 - Vita: also was wondering if you wanted to come here tomorrow instead of me going to you - i have a fair bit of work to do for this exam on thurs so might not make it out
16/03/2025, 15:20 - Vita: thanks, appreciate it
16/03/2025, 15:20 - Vita: I’m gonna do the same, defo need a run fr
16/03/2025, 15:21 - Vita: enjoy seeing the family, tell them I say hi
16/03/2025, 15:21 - Vita: at least im not the only one i guess haha
16/03/2025, 15:21 - Vita: what does the timing metric mean?
16/03/2025, 15:28 - Tim Farrelly: No worries! I don't need it today :)
16/03/2025, 15:28 - Tim Farrelly: Can just tell the gym folks you stole it;)
16/03/2025, 15:29 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah that sounds good:) Would appreciate being able to practice my thesis presentation
16/03/2025, 15:29 - Tim Farrelly: If it suits you and you feel up to it
16/03/2025, 15:30 - Tim Farrelly: Recommend! You should, it's a bit chillier out than it looks heads up
16/03/2025, 15:30 - Tim Farrelly: I'm gonna get a very quick gym session in - I've been *horrifically* unproductive thus far today but ah sure
16/03/2025, 15:31 - Tim Farrelly: Feel like it'd be good to lift some weights - was just a quick short run there
16/03/2025, 15:31 - Tim Farrelly: I think that's with respect to the time I'm getting to sleep at haha
16/03/2025, 15:32 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
16/03/2025, 15:53 - Tim Farrelly: American tourists are an invasive species
16/03/2025, 15:53 - Tim Farrelly: 📉📉📉
16/03/2025, 16:35 - Vita: ah grand, nearly had a heart attack thinking you’d be needing it badly hahaha
16/03/2025, 16:35 - Vita: might hang on it come to think of it…. 😌
16/03/2025, 16:36 - Vita: yeah ofc, only if you let me practise a cranial nerves exam on you tho lol
16/03/2025, 16:36 - Vita: ah yeah i had a feeling, but thankfully the suns back out now
16/03/2025, 16:37 - Vita: how long did you go for with the run in the end? im curious about combining running and weight training, have heard good things
16/03/2025, 16:37 - Vita: ahahahhaa i hope it scares you straight asap
16/03/2025, 16:37 - Vita: was the dart jammers? :(
16/03/2025, 16:37 - Vita: going for my run now finally, kept getting distracted lol
16/03/2025, 17:02 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
16/03/2025, 17:03 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
16/03/2025, 17:56 - Tim Farrelly: You haven't read crime and punishment have you?
16/03/2025, 19:49 - Vita: No I havent!
16/03/2025, 19:49 - Vita: ahhhhh :,)
16/03/2025, 19:50 - Vita: you can see how happy lily is to see you hahaha
16/03/2025, 19:50 - Vita: sorry the avocado is rogue💀
16/03/2025, 19:50 - Vita: booked for a gait assessment in the run hub in a couple of weeks, interested to see how that’ll turn out
16/03/2025, 19:50 - Vita: just to prevent any injuries now im running more
16/03/2025, 19:50 - Vita: have you ever been?
16/03/2025, 20:34 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah they bother were following me around wagging their tails haha!
16/03/2025, 20:34 - Tim Farrelly: Was lovely to see them
16/03/2025, 20:34 - Tim Farrelly: The dinner was absolutely delicious
16/03/2025, 20:35 - Tim Farrelly: It's better vita, trust me
16/03/2025, 20:35 - Tim Farrelly: Avocado+ the gratins is the ultimate creaminess
16/03/2025, 20:35 - Tim Farrelly: Ah that sounds like a great idea! I've never been, but that sounds like it could genuinely be worth doing... I assume they give you in soles if you need them?
16/03/2025, 20:36 - Tim Farrelly: Or suggest changing running technique
16/03/2025, 20:36 - Tim Farrelly: Have been back now a bit, just chilling, but about to get stuck into work
16/03/2025, 20:36 - Tim Farrelly: Finally got my posters anyways! And picked up some fiction books I'll be reading soon:)
16/03/2025, 20:36 - Tim Farrelly: Productive day?
16/03/2025, 20:56 - Vita: awwww
16/03/2025, 20:56 - Vita: how was seeing the fam?
16/03/2025, 20:56 - Vita: i am seriously bearish on avo with a roast 👀
16/03/2025, 20:56 - Vita: glad to hear it! what time did you head there for?
16/03/2025, 20:57 - Vita: yeah i think they suggest running shoes/insoles/technique based on their findings - i’m going on the 28th of march and v excited tbh lol
16/03/2025, 20:57 - Vita: i was noticing some musculoskeletal pain from my running technique so wanna troubleshoot to protect my joints in the long term
16/03/2025, 20:58 - Vita: ah nice! have you put em up yet,
16/03/2025, 20:58 - Vita: *?
16/03/2025, 20:58 - Vita: and yeah its been very productive, I think i need to be locked in like this for the next few weeks to get back on top of everything
16/03/2025, 20:58 - Vita: itll be a grim-ish grind but hopefully worth it
16/03/2025, 20:58 - Vita: how are you feeling this evening btw?
16/03/2025, 20:58 - Vita: (emotionally that is haha)
16/03/2025, 21:11 - Tim Farrelly: yeah was really nice - after Tuesday ill probs start looking at booking things for Italy - just have to make sure Jim is ok staying here by himself and that we leave at a good time
16/03/2025, 21:11 - Tim Farrelly: you'll have to try it!
16/03/2025, 21:11 - Tim Farrelly: the meat was a roast leg of lamb and my sis did an amazing Indian spice rub on it
16/03/2025, 21:12 - Tim Farrelly: about 4.30ish I thik
16/03/2025, 21:12 - Tim Farrelly: think
16/03/2025, 21:12 - Tim Farrelly: Very good shout. I love my shoes, but I'd wonder if I should change my technique - would be interested to hear if they give you many pointers
16/03/2025, 21:13 - Tim Farrelly: ok so I have the posters haha, but just realising that I don't have the magnetic frames that I used to hold them up
16/03/2025, 21:13 - Tim Farrelly: might see if I can just put them up as they are with the tape you gave me - ordering some stronger stuff in the meantime that I used to use!
16/03/2025, 21:16 - Tim Farrelly: haha yeah ehm a good bit better, seeing the family was nice, but not myself still... I think I have FOV on the back of my mind a bit more now + the other night
16/03/2025, 21:16 - Tim Farrelly: But feeling a good bit better - I think just getting stuck into work now will be good - I feel rested anyways for sure lol
16/03/2025, 21:17 - Tim Farrelly: How about you?
16/03/2025, 22:34 - Vita: aw thats great, hows he been recovering from his surg btw? hes not still crawling up stairs i hope lol
16/03/2025, 22:35 - Vita: damn that sounds absolutely lovely
16/03/2025, 22:35 - Vita: we had lemon chicken with cream for our dinner it was pretty banging
16/03/2025, 22:35 - Vita: yeah i’ll let you know! really hoping its not them trying to get me to buy a 600 quid pair of shoes tho lmao
16/03/2025, 22:36 - Vita: but ive heard great things from my friends so doubt its that
16/03/2025, 22:36 - Vita: let me know how you fare! I wanna see pics when theyre up
16/03/2025, 22:36 - Vita: oh hey! lol
16/03/2025, 22:36 - Vita: im on the toilet rn xxx
16/03/2025, 22:37 - Vita: its free afaik so you should give it a go too! theyre on aungier st so like right near you
16/03/2025, 22:37 - Vita: fov work to do or thoughts of leaving the compnay?
16/03/2025, 22:38 - Vita: yeah a bit better, despite this being a horribly hurtful experience im still really looking forward to seeing you tomorrow which can only be a good sign hahaha
16/03/2025, 22:54 - Tim Farrelly: Ditto hehe
16/03/2025, 22:54 - Tim Farrelly: Xx
16/03/2025, 22:55 - Tim Farrelly: I think he's getting on well! Except there might be a bit of an infection in his ankle - he mentioned that a few days ago when I called but forgot to ask about it today
16/03/2025, 22:55 - Tim Farrelly: (apparently it was oozing when the docs looked at it and he was in for a visit)
16/03/2025, 22:56 - Tim Farrelly: I've noticing a little bit of pain in my shins at times, or not quite pain, but strain/ tenderness, so definitely worth me giving it a go + probably chatting to ChatGPT lol
16/03/2025, 22:56 - Tim Farrelly: Will unroll them and send a pic, but likely not putting up tonight!
16/03/2025, 22:57 - Tim Farrelly: Oh that's a very good deal so
16/03/2025, 22:57 - Tim Farrelly: The latter :')
16/03/2025, 22:57 - Tim Farrelly: Will have to have a convo with the guys early this week
16/03/2025, 22:58 - Tim Farrelly: Also some work too tbh - I forgot to do record a match in Australia on Friday but not the end of the world
16/03/2025, 23:00 - Tim Farrelly: Ah well I'm really very glad to hear the latter anyways, I'm looking forward to seeing you too:)
17/03/2025, 00:14 - Vita: oh feck I hope they get that sorted pronto, not good - is he otherwise well in himself?
17/03/2025, 00:15 - Vita: i saw something a little while ago about this and training your tibialis anterior muscle with kettlebells to help with it. but maybe ask chatgpt lol
17/03/2025, 00:15 - Vita: please do, interested to see what theyre like!
17/03/2025, 00:16 - Vita: oh damn are you gonna be softlaunching your exit this week so?
17/03/2025, 00:16 - Vita: im just finished work here lol, what a day - got lots done but brain is lowkey fried so gonna watch some sex and the city and head to sleep methinks
17/03/2025, 00:17 - Vita: stupidly drank too much coffee today so might require a melatonin to drift off hahaha
17/03/2025, 00:17 - Vita: anyway goodnight tim, sleep well xx
17/03/2025, 01:27 - Tim Farrelly: very successful procrastinating:

https://rcsiheritage.blogspot.com/2014/12/glass-that-sparkles-and-shines.html
17/03/2025, 03:05 - Tim Farrelly: I may or may not have just bought €41 of honey 👀👀
17/03/2025, 05:09 - Tim Farrelly: Goodnight lol, text you tmrw
17/03/2025, 10:05 - Vita: amazing!
17/03/2025, 10:05 - Vita: did you ever get into the church next door to rcsi with all the nice stained glass btw? the one we popped into on culture night?!
17/03/2025, 10:05 - Vita: damn lol
17/03/2025, 10:05 - Vita: how many kilos?
17/03/2025, 12:11 - Vita: also what time do you want to come over tonight? still feeling pretty horrible today if im honest
17/03/2025, 14:05 - Tim Farrelly: Hello!
17/03/2025, 14:06 - Tim Farrelly: I'm just out of the shower lol
17/03/2025, 14:06 - Vita: sorry just having lunch wqs popping by to say just come over whenever sure lol
17/03/2025, 14:06 - Tim Farrelly: Not yet! Still meaning to - need to find a way into rcsi tho now too
17/03/2025, 14:06 - Tim Farrelly: 2kg
17/03/2025, 14:07 - Tim Farrelly: Ah sorry to hear that. 

I'm not too sure right now tbh. At the minute, I just need to get stuck in immediately I think I get my evaluation done
17/03/2025, 14:07 - Tim Farrelly: And then create some graphics, and then write a script
17/03/2025, 14:08 - Tim Farrelly: Was nowhere near as productive as I expected to be last night unfortunately
17/03/2025, 14:15 - Tim Farrelly: Have you gotten out for a walk or anything yet today:) ?
17/03/2025, 14:17 - Vita: hmm probs a good investment. any idea how much you saved?
17/03/2025, 14:18 - Vita: there’s a bad joke to be made here but it would be in poor taste at present
17/03/2025, 14:19 - Vita: what I’m mostly asking is if you want dinner or not lol - we’re having lemon meatballs around 7:30 so just lmk if it’ll be before or after then
17/03/2025, 14:20 - Tim Farrelly: A little over €8 per kilo!
17/03/2025, 14:20 - Tim Farrelly: Hahahahaha
17/03/2025, 14:20 - Tim Farrelly: You still have it
17/03/2025, 14:21 - Tim Farrelly: Oh very nice! Can I confirm with you in 20 minutes once I sit down and see how much I actually have to do, but I probably will come over for then:)
17/03/2025, 14:21 - Tim Farrelly: Are you still going out tonight with your Canadian friend?
17/03/2025, 14:22 - Vita: don’t really feel like it, I probably won’t
17/03/2025, 14:22 - Vita: haha at what cost
17/03/2025, 14:22 - Vita: yeah sure!
17/03/2025, 14:23 - Tim Farrelly: Aww Vita:')
17/03/2025, 14:23 - Tim Farrelly: Have you been out for a walk?
17/03/2025, 14:23 - Vita: not yet - emma came over this morning to practise physical exams, I’m planning on doing another ~hour here and then going to the gym
17/03/2025, 14:24 - Vita: no tbh to clarify I will not be going out
17/03/2025, 14:24 - Vita: he’s doing a pub crawl which will likely be in town and likely swarming with americans
17/03/2025, 14:24 - Vita: and for the sake of my sanity im gonna avoid
17/03/2025, 14:25 - Vita: so dw you wont be stuck home alone with my parents ahhaha
17/03/2025, 14:25 - Tim Farrelly: Ah that's good to hear. Gym will be good - glad to hear it's open, I hope Trinity is, I might try pop in then if so
17/03/2025, 14:25 - Vita: hahaha thats tbc - if its not I’ll just go for a long walk i’d say
17/03/2025, 14:25 - Tim Farrelly: Likely I think is an understatement
17/03/2025, 14:25 - Vita: tho a long walk might just be the ticket at present
17/03/2025, 14:25 - Tim Farrelly: I can hear them from my kitchen here while I'm eating yoghurt hahah
17/03/2025, 14:26 - Vita: fuck me thats horrifying hahaha
17/03/2025, 14:26 - Tim Farrelly: That'd also be very nice!
17/03/2025, 14:26 - Vita: sorry to hear this though, any particular reason or just had more to do than anticipated?
17/03/2025, 14:26 - Tim Farrelly: Focus just isn't what it is atm
17/03/2025, 14:27 - Tim Farrelly: I think I need to get meditating... I've said that many times before, but yeah, could be good - from a productivity point of view ofc👀
17/03/2025, 14:28 - Tim Farrelly: But also, more to do than expected. I also spent a bit of time doing some things worth trying if I had a bit more time, but that didn't work out anyways, and should have focused on the core things I need to get done that are essential
17/03/2025, 14:29 - Vita: ahaha you and me both - i over caffeinated hoping it’d make me lock in and all it did was bring me close to tears💀
17/03/2025, 14:29 - Vita: you probably should before bed, would probs do a lot of good for winding down!
17/03/2025, 14:29 - Vita: i used to find that at least
17/03/2025, 14:29 - Tim Farrelly: Awwwww vita:')
17/03/2025, 14:29 - Tim Farrelly: Hahahaha that's terrible
17/03/2025, 14:30 - Vita: ah fair enough. goodspeed with it anyway
17/03/2025, 14:31 - Vita: what’s terrible is that bringing me close to tears was an understatement lmao but fuck it we ball
17/03/2025, 14:32 - Vita: anyway I’d better get back to work, let me know asap if you want in on dinner
17/03/2025, 14:33 - Tim Farrelly: Will do! Just making a smoothie:)
17/03/2025, 14:47 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
17/03/2025, 14:47 - Tim Farrelly: Hmm was hoping for more but ah sure
17/03/2025, 15:11 - Tim Farrelly: sorry I don't think I'll actually make it out in time for dinner - as nutritious and non-microwave meal as I'm sure it'll be;)
17/03/2025, 16:42 - Vita: home from my walk now anyway, feeling a good bit better. hope you are too + work is going well
17/03/2025, 16:43 - Vita: looking forward to later anyway, i’m happy to put this behind us xx
17/03/2025, 16:43 - Vita: i’ll even change out of my juicies into jeans just for you ;)
17/03/2025, 17:04 - Tim Farrelly: Me too:)
17/03/2025, 17:05 - Tim Farrelly: I'm really glad to hear that
17/03/2025, 17:05 - Tim Farrelly: Failed attempt at going gym:') Closed today unfortunately!
17/03/2025, 17:05 - Tim Farrelly: Seems the whole campus is closed with how quiet it is
17/03/2025, 17:05 - Tim Farrelly: Otherwise there'd be a literal stampede of Americans around
17/03/2025, 17:06 - Tim Farrelly: I think I might get out for a walk now myself, but probably a bit more thesis work first, just wanna get our whole it's still light out
17/03/2025, 18:50 - Vita: aw rip, haha well that makes two of us I guess😅
17/03/2025, 18:50 - Vita: im gonna have to go tomorrow since i’ll be away this weekend and wanna get my three sessions in
17/03/2025, 18:51 - Vita: there were a crazy amount of gardai around when i went for my walk, imagine they didnt want to deal with opening the floodgates of tcd…
17/03/2025, 18:51 - Vita: hope you managed! i’ve been revising - going well now anyway thank god
17/03/2025, 18:53 - Tim Farrelly: I think I'm sort of getting there now - just need to finish up my slides
17/03/2025, 18:53 - Tim Farrelly: and write a script lol
17/03/2025, 18:53 - Tim Farrelly: and go through it a few times
17/03/2025, 18:53 - Tim Farrelly: there's a good bit of stuff that I haven't got done but is what it is
17/03/2025, 18:53 - Tim Farrelly: I think its decent enough
17/03/2025, 18:54 - Tim Farrelly: matthew et al are in town, so I'm going to hang out with them for a bit, likely from 8.30 to just before 10 if things go well here. Is it cool for me to come over to you after then?
17/03/2025, 18:57 - Vita: thought the plan was for you to come here for 9?
17/03/2025, 18:58 - Vita: I mean you can always finish off stuff here if you’d like?

17/03/2025, 21:02 - Vita: awww what a king
18/03/2025, 10:19 - Tim Farrelly: Are you in the matter?
18/03/2025, 10:22 - Vita: no! I ended up staying home to prep for the exam on thursday and just work on that all day haha
18/03/2025, 10:22 - Vita: im just downstairs - sorry for the slamming of doors my mum was rushing out
18/03/2025, 11:49 - Vita: good luck! you’ll smash it x
18/03/2025, 12:37 - Tim Farrelly: Just out, went well I think!
18/03/2025, 12:38 - Tim Farrelly: Gonna get a mamas revenge:)
18/03/2025, 13:50 - Vita: amazing!!!
18/03/2025, 13:50 - Vita: so so proud of you:)
18/03/2025, 13:50 - Vita: well deserved! hope you get to enjoy it outside!!
18/03/2025, 13:50 - Vita: also just found out i was supposed to be in mater for manual handling today lmfao
18/03/2025, 13:50 - Vita: (training thing we have to do. utterly pointless)
18/03/2025, 13:51 - Tim Farrelly: Ah just as well you missed it then I guess haha;)
18/03/2025, 13:51 - Tim Farrelly: Hopefully not mandatory tho
18/03/2025, 13:52 - Tim Farrelly: Feeling a bit unwell, so I've just been lying in bed, but gonna get out now for a shop, it really is so beautiful out!
18/03/2025, 13:52 - Tim Farrelly: Think I caught a cold, or am just very low on sleep, might have a nap actually when I'm back, but get out now while it's bright out
18/03/2025, 14:23 - Vita: <Media omitted>
18/03/2025, 14:54 - Vita: btw ive brought in a squishier pillow to my room for you for when you next stay over x
18/03/2025, 15:22 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
18/03/2025, 15:27 - Vita: <Media omitted>
18/03/2025, 15:54 - Vita: also found a place in town that sells long black lace gloves! wanna come with me next week to pick them up if we’re out and about in town? hehe
18/03/2025, 18:21 - Vita: in the gym but seem to have hurt my knee doing split squats with a bench that was too low :(
18/03/2025, 18:30 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
18/03/2025, 18:32 - Vita: aw im sorry to hear that - the bowels wouldnt be due to friday night in any case
18/03/2025, 18:32 - Vita: but its possible you picked something up when you were out on friday
18/03/2025, 18:32 - Tim Farrelly: Maybe! Or last night?
18/03/2025, 18:32 - Vita: especially because alcohol depresses the immune system
18/03/2025, 18:32 - Vita: so my bet would be it was either while heavily drinking or the day after
18/03/2025, 18:32 - Tim Farrelly: All the symptoms are just coming on since this morning - would that be too fast to start showing symptoms since last night?
18/03/2025, 18:33 - Vita: tbh it depends on the bug, anyones best guess :( in any case your best bet now is to rest up and take 2x paracetamol every 6 hours xx
18/03/2025, 18:33 - Tim Farrelly: Any idea what it sounds like? Just rest + paracetamol is the shout Im guessing
18/03/2025, 18:33 - Vita: can take ibuprofen in between paracetamol dosing if you need an extra boost
18/03/2025, 18:33 - Tim Farrelly: Paracetamol should be all good! Thanks :)
18/03/2025, 18:33 - Tim Farrelly: Might bring my laptop to bed hehe:)
18/03/2025, 18:34 - Vita: just sounds like a nondescript virus to me - no specific features of anything particularly wild or wonderful lol
18/03/2025, 18:34 - Vita: but hope you feel better soon :(
18/03/2025, 18:34 - Vita: do!
18/03/2025, 18:34 - Vita: i’d say just go to bed for the evening and do actually try to get an early night ;) hehe
18/03/2025, 18:36 - Tim Farrelly: Sounds good!
18/03/2025, 18:36 - Tim Farrelly: Quick microwave meal first haha, then shall settle in hehe
18/03/2025, 18:36 - Vita: lmk how you’re doing tomorrow anyway can drop in some miso if youre still poorly
18/03/2025, 18:36 - Vita: hehehe yesss

18/03/2025, 19:12 - Tim Farrelly: guess who got 100% on an assignment that was due at midnight, I started at 9 before deciding I'd fancy going to the gym, and then managed to submit by 23:23

worth 25% of our grade, and apparently took others days to complete hehe
18/03/2025, 19:12 - Tim Farrelly: hahahahaha
18/03/2025, 19:13 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>

18/03/2025, 19:30 - Vita: i saw this out of context for a sec and thought you got 100 on your presentation earlier hehehe
18/03/2025, 19:30 - Vita: although i wouldnt be surprised ;)
18/03/2025, 19:30 - Vita: just polished off some dinner + steamed pudding, gonna make a cuppa and get back to it:)
18/03/2025, 20:08 - Tim Farrelly: hahahaha I kinda can't believe it tbh
18/03/2025, 20:08 - Tim Farrelly: quite gas - college, at least cs college, is a joke lol

18/03/2025, 20:43 - Vita: aw thats ideal:) im slightly concerned ive picked up whatever you have since im slightly off form / just feeling a bit headachey and strange but gonna do another two hours and head to bed i think!
18/03/2025, 22:25 - Vita: btw we should have the steak date night soon hehe - you could come here and I cook them or we do them at yours? just remembered there while i was working lol
18/03/2025, 22:32 - Tim Farrelly: aww no - sorry was worried that might happen - symptoms only started showing this morning unfortunately
18/03/2025, 22:32 - Tim Farrelly: hope you're ok
18/03/2025, 22:32 - Tim Farrelly: I managed to get quite a lot of work done there anyways for Patch at least - somewhat surprisingly, just from bed hahah
18/03/2025, 22:33 - Tim Farrelly: oh yes - lets!
18/03/2025, 22:33 - Tim Farrelly: I'd say yours is probably the better shout!
18/03/2025, 22:33 - Tim Farrelly: I don't have a frying pan here lol
18/03/2025, 22:34 - Tim Farrelly: unless we were to borrow someone elses
18/03/2025, 23:07 - Vita: i’m alright - just tired and a little grumpy + have acid reflux which is totally unrelated but super annoying >:(

18/03/2025, 23:08 - Vita: ahahahaha so fair
18/03/2025, 23:09 - Vita: sounds good so anyway - I’d like to work fun nice stuff like that into our study dates (zakura + study date + anal another time soon…?) just to keep me going in the final stretch lol

19/03/2025, 16:23 - Vita: hope you’ve been taking it easy today tho! what have you been up to?
19/03/2025, 16:24 - Vita: ive been feeling okay, a little smidge off form from going 100 all day especially with suboptimal sleep amounts and being slightly deconditioned with this mild cold - dont seem to have developed it as badly as you though so hopefully will get off lightly😅
19/03/2025, 16:25 - Vita: might do anki in bed until dinnertime though after the gym
19/03/2025, 16:25 - Vita: and then do a mock exam or two

20/03/2025, 16:35 - Vita: also tbh with time constraints im afraid to say that I’ll only be able to drop over some 7up around 6… and since I’ll be getting a lift I probs wont be able to get fresh squeezed orange juice :(
20/03/2025, 16:35 - Vita: is the fresh stuff from the shop okay or does it have to be fresh from the machine lmao
20/03/2025, 16:35 - Vita: bc if its the latter i am afraid no can do :,)
20/03/2025, 16:48 - Tim Farrelly: All good!
20/03/2025, 16:49 - Tim Farrelly: Fresh stuff from the shop is 💯, just not Tropicana stuff
20/03/2025, 16:49 - Tim Farrelly: But if they don't have it, no worries at all
20/03/2025, 16:49 - Vita: I’ll see what I can do;)

28/03/2025, 20:34 - Tim Farrelly: What makes it harder
28/03/2025, 20:34 - Tim Farrelly: Does Emma subtly remind you stuff?
28/03/2025, 20:34 - Tim Farrelly: Going well so far!
28/03/2025, 20:37 - Vita: no just genuinely that I’m “in the zone” for study when im with her
28/03/2025, 20:37 - Vita: whereas my mum gets really giddy and distracted
28/03/2025, 20:37 - Vita: which makes it harder for me to wrack my brains for things i mightve forgotten hahaha

28/03/2025, 20:39 - Vita: but like she will tell me after if i forget stuff

29/03/2025, 15:11 - Vita: i’d love that:)
29/03/2025, 15:13 - Vita: and a headsup that i will be understandably stressed over the next month so bear with me :,) (so basically apologies in advance if im changing plans around to study or not able to see you quite as much as I’d like to) final stretch now!
29/03/2025, 15:26 - Tim Farrelly: Of course - totally understandable:)
29/03/2025, 15:26 - Tim Farrelly: College is more important for some of us;)
29/03/2025, 16:04 - Vita: hehehe listen all im saying is i dont think the hse has the infrastructure to let chatgpt run things juuuuust yet ;)
29/03/2025, 16:08 - Tim Farrelly: hahahaha
29/03/2025, 16:08 - Tim Farrelly: not _just_ yet ;)
29/03/2025, 16:09 - Tim Farrelly: ive been doing another assignment in the back of a group meeting for another course thing
29/03/2025, 16:09 - Tim Farrelly: im being efficient hehe - but god, other people really just don't get stuff done
29/03/2025, 16:31 - Tim Farrelly: Somebody has definitely taken my pasta from my shelf 😞
29/03/2025, 16:32 - Tim Farrelly: One thing I'm sure that I had
29/03/2025, 16:32 - Tim Farrelly: Very distinctly remember buying it, and having it in my press, and then I guess didn't notice when it went missing. And there's no chance I would have given it back to my family
29/03/2025, 16:40 - Vita: hehehehe
29/03/2025, 16:40 - Vita: no fr other people are the downfall:(
29/03/2025, 16:40 - Vita: is the ongoing meeting being inefficient? lol
29/03/2025, 16:40 - Vita: NOOOO :(
29/03/2025, 16:41 - Vita: awww im sorry
29/03/2025, 16:41 - Vita: who do you reckon the culprit is?👀
29/03/2025, 16:41 - Vita: you’ll be extra ready for zakura tonight anyway :(

29/03/2025, 17:03 - Tim Farrelly: I'd imagine it has to be Henry - everyone else is always stocked up on food, and henry has his wok in the bottom shelf of the press i use
29/03/2025, 17:03 - Tim Farrelly: there's a small possibility that I did bring the pasta home, but I just can't imagine that I would have done that lol
29/03/2025, 17:04 - Tim Farrelly: might send him a text later just to ask lol
29/03/2025, 17:04 - Tim Farrelly: exactly!

29/03/2025, 17:05 - Tim Farrelly: Would you fancy meeting up before 6 for a walk maybe, coming back here to chill for a bit, and then zakura?
29/03/2025, 17:05 - Tim Farrelly: We could do some co studying/ co James Turrell coding later if you'd like after zakura:)
29/03/2025, 17:06 - Tim Farrelly: I think my website is really gonna look so good! At least on a desktop
29/03/2025, 17:06 - Vita: im still in my lounge gear so chances of me making it there before 6 are fairly low ahahaha
29/03/2025, 17:07 - Tim Farrelly: fair enough hahah!

03/04/2025, 23:24 - Tim Farrelly: was absolutely delicious - they have a new bowl too! mushrooms feature but I think I might ask them to swap that out and try it sometime - Japanese inspired apparently
03/04/2025, 23:24 - Tim Farrelly: sort of - they've compelted shifted which is quite shit and very hard to fix - but I think things should still work quite well once I calibrate them:)

08/04/2025, 21:47 - Tim Farrelly: The cost ascribed to starting something always crumbles once ya start haha (usually)

08/04/2025, 21:53 - Vita: i feel i can blunder my way through here
08/04/2025, 22:02 - Tim Farrelly: I think in large part a fluctutation but I think it's just coming towards the end of college and wondering if I should have tried to have a bit more spare time and done more "college" things I think !
08/04/2025, 22:36 - Vita: yes it is very much big reflection time with the end being close - I’ve been feeling similar feelings somewhat
08/04/2025, 22:36 - Vita: but i will say tim you did loads this year!
08/04/2025, 22:36 - Vita: at least definitely in my opinion:)

09/04/2025, 02:58 - Tim Farrelly: ah generally did loads! But don't feel like I spent a whole lot of time with class mates! I've a good connection with Oisin very naturally - but haven't really done much out with him - but haven't really gotten to know the others too well I think is the main thing - but no harm really !
09/04/2025, 02:58 - Tim Farrelly: big sadface:')

13/04/2025, 17:53 - Vita: i wanna do a quick sketch of one of mums plants later if i get time - so might start with that and get started on the meadow next weekend or one of the evenings next week hehe

16/04/2025, 04:03 - Tim Farrelly: so I might have stayed up working to get an assignment done - did indeed - and its a big one, worth like 40 or 60% I think - and I think I did something relatively fast (like just tonight, a couple of hours, but which I think should get me lots of marks lol). I had been trying something else which I spent a good bit more time on before, but couldn't get it workign just right
16/04/2025, 04:03 - Tim Farrelly: now just need to make a youtube video for it tmrw - otherwise, the report is written and all that
16/04/2025, 04:03 - Tim Farrelly: so just have the thesis left + a couple assignments due next week, but they're nothing too crazy
16/04/2025, 04:04 - Tim Farrelly: I think I genuinely probably did a solid 15 hours of work today lol - like including the walking I did + eating food lol
16/04/2025, 04:06 - Tim Farrelly: like have been awake 17 hours and didn't really break at all - tmrw I shall though lol - need to get to the gym
16/04/2025, 08:29 - Vita: hahahaha holy shit you’re a machine!
16/04/2025, 08:29 - Vita: good morning btw:)
16/04/2025, 08:29 - Vita: im just waiting on the bus into campus, late bc got distracted chatting with my parents at breakfast lol

10/05/2025, 21:58 - Vita: awwww bless :,)
10/05/2025, 21:58 - Vita: looks v cosy!!
10/05/2025, 21:58 - Vita: that was the marching band the other day!
10/05/2025, 21:59 - Vita: its started raining *heavy* so paddleboarding is off the cards :,(
10/05/2025, 21:59 - Vita: but we’re playing cards and reading instead hehe
10/05/2025, 22:01 - Tim Farrelly: enjoy!
10/05/2025, 22:01 - Tim Farrelly: ive come up with an idea for a nice lil side project potentially - an ai powered productivity/ time tracker that takes and sends screenshots of your sreen to ChatGPT
10/05/2025, 22:02 - Tim Farrelly: might be a kinda big project, so just gonna work on my website for a little bit, and probs come back to that tmrw or another day
10/05/2025, 22:02 - Tim Farrelly: want to watch Warfare movie later I think - its just 1.5 hours and I heard good things
10/05/2025, 22:40 - Vita: ooh let me know what you think! havent heard much about it - when’d it come out? :)
10/05/2025, 22:40 - Vita: ooooh this would be very good!
10/05/2025, 22:41 - Vita: and very helpful for you to track your time with patch or fov perchance….?
10/05/2025, 22:41 - Vita: lmk how the website goes! excited to see how its progressed 👀
10/05/2025, 22:41 - Vita: we’re checking out soon properly so im gonna grab a shower rn hehe
10/05/2025, 23:08 - Tim Farrelly: Recently enough I think! It's just on the illegal streaming sites now like haha
10/05/2025, 23:09 - Tim Farrelly: I think so! I ended up not being very productive this evening but that's grand, think I'm a bit tired to truly get stuck into a coding project, but think I'll try get some done tmrw before I go out to Sam's
10/05/2025, 23:10 - Tim Farrelly: Either my personal website or something else (having second thoughts about the Jakes Turrell design... I might try something else in the meantime potentially but still come back and finish it just to have a version. I'm not sure if folks would be too confused if they were to visit it for the first time and not see text hahah)
10/05/2025, 23:10 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah I think so!
10/05/2025, 23:10 - Tim Farrelly: Safe travels!
10/05/2025, 23:28 - Vita: hehehe >:)
10/05/2025, 23:28 - Vita: very good! let me know the full review! we’re just working out dinner options in panacha before our ten hour (🤢) bus lol
10/05/2025, 23:29 - Vita: sounds like a plan! you should definitely rest up if you feel you need it x
10/05/2025, 23:29 - Vita: ahh this makes sense - what are your thoughts as an alternative ?
10/05/2025, 23:29 - Vita: though the james turrell would be sooooo fuckin sexy
10/05/2025, 23:29 - Vita: pity its not the most intuitive :(
10/05/2025, 23:30 - Vita: thank you! look forward to calling you from beside the infinity pool ;)
11/05/2025, 00:59 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
11/05/2025, 01:21 - Vita: oooh very interesting about the usa - I need to read more about bush and his atrocities because i’ve heard it in passing multiple times but never did a deep dive myself..

11/05/2025, 18:04 - Vita: so turns out this hostel is not all that meets the eye… a lot of people got gastro here so gonna stick to bottled water and not eat much from here
11/05/2025, 18:04 - Vita: and we’re gonna go into the local village to eat i think
11/05/2025, 18:04 - Vita: its a big step down from the last one - the food was actually *heavenly* there

12/05/2025, 02:43 - Tim Farrelly: Not in the centre, but a 15 minute (10 for us;) ) walk from a train that'd bring us to the centre + is on a lake
12/05/2025, 02:43 - Tim Farrelly: That's in stockholm
12/05/2025, 02:43 - Tim Farrelly: Check it out
12/05/2025, 02:43 - Tim Farrelly: Probably between there + Prague
12/05/2025, 03:34 - Tim Farrelly: Let me know if you might be free for a call to look at travel options tmrw evening ! I'm kinda getting sucked into researching hahah
12/05/2025, 04:40 - Vita: i’d love to! it’ll be after 4:30pm my time if thats okay since we’re caving from 8:30 to 4:30!

12/05/2025, 05:25 - Vita: id be so happy with either that or prague

12/05/2025, 16:42 - Tim Farrelly: ill hopefully get out for a walk and to the gym soon - just working from home today to save time
12/05/2025, 21:06 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
12/05/2025, 23:43 - Vita: just home now! crazy day hehe
12/05/2025, 23:44 - Vita: will send pics in a bit! barely got any on my phone and also we werent able to bring our phones into the cave! but was very very cool
12/05/2025, 23:47 - Tim Farrelly: hello
12/05/2025, 23:48 - Vita: <Media omitted>
12/05/2025, 23:55 - Tim Farrelly: any photos!?
12/05/2025, 23:55 - Tim Farrelly: ah 45 seconds in now
12/05/2025, 23:56 - Tim Farrelly: ah that sounds like a great success anyways!
12/05/2025, 23:57 - Tim Farrelly: wouldn't mind some bbq soon
12/05/2025, 23:57 - Tim Farrelly: i think ill get Camille soon actually - thats just across the road from us here
12/05/2025, 23:57 - Tim Farrelly: hope you're enjoying the beer and vibes
12/05/2025, 23:57 - Tim Farrelly: im still just up working - didn't get to management stuff yet - but I've almost cleared myself of most work that I need to get done this week so thats good:)
12/05/2025, 23:57 - Tim Farrelly: for patch that is
13/05/2025, 00:02 - Vita: i need to get them off evan! he took them with his phone hehe
13/05/2025, 00:02 - Vita: <Media omitted>
13/05/2025, 00:02 - Vita: <Media omitted>
13/05/2025, 00:02 - Vita: these are the only ones from today!
13/05/2025, 00:02 - Vita: that i got hehe
13/05/2025, 00:02 - Tim Farrelly: water looks beautiful!
13/05/2025, 00:02 - Vita: this was from yesterday not sure if i sent!
13/05/2025, 00:02 - Vita: omg tim it was gorgeous
13/05/2025, 00:02 - Vita: <Media omitted>
13/05/2025, 00:02 - Vita: so so fresh but warm
13/05/2025, 00:03 - Vita: we had an amazing swim
13/05/2025, 00:03 - Vita: so much wildlife too!
13/05/2025, 00:03 - Vita: we heard the howling monkeys, tried to get a recording for you but it didnt work :,(
13/05/2025, 00:03 - Tim Farrelly: ps im researching Stockholm while procrastinating atm hahah - just trying to gauge costs/ things to do vs prage. Will make a notion page that will include the flight prices and times, which will probably be the deciding factor I think! Swedish food is quite expensive in Stockholm, *but* they have lots of Vietnamese food for some reason
13/05/2025, 00:03 - Vita: if the weathers good when im home we should have a bbq date on my terrace :,)
13/05/2025, 00:03 - Vita: +/- mojitos ;)
13/05/2025, 00:04 - Vita: oooh! i would fuck with stockholm in the summer heavy
13/05/2025, 00:04 - Tim Farrelly: your abs never fail to... not surprise me, but like, how and wow
13/05/2025, 00:04 - Vita: oooh do! lmk what you get :,)
13/05/2025, 00:04 - Tim Farrelly: thatd be lovely!
13/05/2025, 00:04 - Vita: ;) hehehe what can i say
13/05/2025, 00:04 - Tim Farrelly: ofc!
13/05/2025, 00:04 - Tim Farrelly: ah here will we just go with Stockholm!
13/05/2025, 00:05 - Vita: looking forward to activating them from laughter laying in bed with you again :,)
13/05/2025, 00:05 - Vita: ah yeah
13/05/2025, 00:05 - Tim Farrelly: prague might be particularly lovely in the autumn and winter
13/05/2025, 00:05 - Vita: lowkey
13/05/2025, 00:05 - Vita: lets do it
13/05/2025, 00:05 - Tim Farrelly: awesome - sorted
13/05/2025, 00:05 - Vita: we can always do this when im working
13/05/2025, 00:05 - Vita: i sense many spontaneous trips in our future :,)
13/05/2025, 00:05 - Tim Farrelly: I'll just look at flights and such, but might provisionally book that airbnb i showed you earlier - even though its a 2 bed, it was quite reasonable!
13/05/2025, 00:05 - Tim Farrelly: fantastic!
13/05/2025, 00:05 - Vita: this sounds ideal:) keep me updated sure!
13/05/2025, 00:06 - Vita: a terrace👀
13/05/2025, 00:06 - Tim Farrelly: the idea i have in my mind:

- London on the 4th and 5th 
- Get a late flight from London to Stockholm on the 5th (a Thursday)
- either stay in Stockholm from Thursday night until Sunday night or Monday (Monday could be good)
13/05/2025, 00:07 - Tim Farrelly: a nice private one;)
13/05/2025, 00:44 - Tim Farrelly: aww this just got booked out:')
13/05/2025, 00:44 - Tim Farrelly: I should have just gone ahead and got it, and been able to refund
13/05/2025, 00:44 - Tim Farrelly: ah well
13/05/2025, 00:45 - Tim Farrelly: ive actually just made this which looks at flights - which will be a tad pricier - but that seems to be the case honestly for any of the cities that we'd be interested in and that we haven't been to yet (you can toggle open the toggle to see the prices for the other cities)

https://www.notion.so/ethereal-society-312/Stockholm-Summer-25-1f10833ba0fa80789cb5e484971c3a2f?pvs=4
13/05/2025, 00:45 - Tim Farrelly: let me know if you can acces
13/05/2025, 00:46 - Tim Farrelly: I was literally about to just book it and then refund if we change our mind - but ah sure
13/05/2025, 00:48 - Tim Farrelly: this is pricier, and non refundable, but probably the best other option I can see on airbnb:

https://www.airbnb.ie/rooms/1203484990597626569?check_in=2025-06-05&check_out=2025-06-09&guests=1&adults=2&s=67&unique_share_id=db4d9f57-f0d4-4a89-b663-6e0d9d7bd922
13/05/2025, 00:48 - Tim Farrelly: its 120 a night effectively
13/05/2025, 00:48 - Tim Farrelly: let me know what you think - ill have a quick look at hotels
13/05/2025, 00:48 - Tim Farrelly: otherwise, feel free to suggest a different city
13/05/2025, 00:52 - Tim Farrelly: hotels are a bit pricier it seems
13/05/2025, 00:56 - Tim Farrelly: of course, prague or Budapest are a bit more plentiful and cheaper airbnb wise
13/05/2025, 00:56 - Tim Farrelly: have a look there anyways and let me know what you think
13/05/2025, 00:57 - Vita: hmmmm
13/05/2025, 00:57 - Vita: i still think stockholm tbh?!
13/05/2025, 00:58 - Vita: i havent been since i was about 10 and would love to go back
13/05/2025, 00:58 - Vita: what are you feeling?!
13/05/2025, 01:12 - Tim Farrelly: sounds good!
13/05/2025, 01:12 - Tim Farrelly: pity about that airbnb but sure its still only like an extra €20 a night for another one!
13/05/2025, 01:19 - Tim Farrelly: Ok so I have provisionally booked this place from the 5th to the 9th!

https://www.airbnb.ie/rooms/50208689?guests=1&adults=1&s=67&unique_share_id=c2b83092-bd87-49cb-8981-eabea91ac6ef

its very cheap, has 4.98 stars, is a 5 min walk to bus stop, which is then apparently 15 mins into the old town
13/05/2025, 01:20 - Tim Farrelly: its fully refundable before June 4th, so we if we find somewhere nicer with a private balcony before then, we can just cancel and shift on over;)
13/05/2025, 01:20 - Tim Farrelly: have a look on airbnb if you get a chance at all!
13/05/2025, 01:25 - Tim Farrelly: I get the feeling its the kinda place where airbnbs pop up and disappear quickly, so its probably worth keeping an eye on things should any sexy balconies or terraces show up!
13/05/2025, 01:25 - Tim Farrelly: anyways, im beyond exhausted now - let me know if that general plan sounds good for you anyways re: the dates
13/05/2025, 01:25 - Tim Farrelly: goodnight xx
13/05/2025, 01:37 - Vita: that sounds ideal ;)
13/05/2025, 01:37 - Vita: I certainly will! will probs be tomorrow evening before i get a chance since we have a 8 hour bus ride taking up most of the day tmw but will get into it :,)
13/05/2025, 01:37 - Vita: dates sound perfect tho!
13/05/2025, 01:38 - Vita: goodnight tim:) xxx
13/05/2025, 01:38 - Vita: so excited for this trip!
13/05/2025, 01:38 - Vita: think itll be a whole lot of fun :,)
13/05/2025, 01:38 - Tim Farrelly: Good night again lol xx
13/05/2025, 01:43 - Tim Farrelly: Ah and we should book a place for a night in London. I assume we'll be out all day, so just ideally somewhere we can drop our bags and is close to public transport
13/05/2025, 01:43 - Tim Farrelly: Hotels/ hostels with private rooms can potentially be cheaper and better located than airbnbs comparatively speaking

This is right beside the British museum, and it's 140 for a private double bed with a shared bathroom. 

If you have time, it might be better to look at London actually!
13/05/2025, 01:53 - Tim Farrelly: Update, actually Airbnb will be better since it's just two of us!

15/05/2025, 00:56 - Vita: in any case

15/05/2025, 02:09 - Tim Farrelly: Will come back to flights tmrw... But an idea. Could be a bit mad but thoughts on flying from stockholm to Paris!!
15/05/2025, 02:09 - Tim Farrelly: On that Monday, fly to Paris instead of back to Dublin, spend a couple nights in Paris, then come home on Wednesday
15/05/2025, 02:18 - Tim Farrelly: https://x.com/luusssso/status/1922809988474388762

15/05/2025, 02:55 - Vita: yeah i actually would be very down for paris - tbh the main thing going against it was that you’ve been so recently!
15/05/2025, 02:55 - Vita: but sleep on it and lmk what you think xx
15/05/2025, 02:55 - Vita: sleep tight tim! xx
15/05/2025, 03:05 - Tim Farrelly: Could fit in well before youre working!

15/05/2025, 20:40 - Tim Farrelly: It could be nice actually to go for a run when you're back I think I've gotten even more unfit since the half marathon
15/05/2025, 22:57 - Vita: hi! arrived but feeling awful from the heat, reply in a bit xx
15/05/2025, 23:11 - Tim Farrelly: Aww hope you're feeling better
15/05/2025, 23:11 - Tim Farrelly: Take your time
15/05/2025, 23:11 - Tim Farrelly: !
15/05/2025, 23:12 - Tim Farrelly: I'm having quite an unproductive evening so I might have a look at flights again now soon

15/05/2025, 23:48 - Tim Farrelly: That doesn't sound fun anyways but I'm sure you'll hopefully feel much better soon
15/05/2025, 23:48 - Tim Farrelly: I'll have a look at flights now anyways and let you know !
15/05/2025, 23:49 - Tim Farrelly: I might just get the outbound from London to Stockholm in the meantime
16/05/2025, 00:08 - Tim Farrelly: Just booked my flight to London for June 4th morning anyways!

here's an easy website where you can def access it without signing in - you just cant edit it
16/05/2025, 00:30 - Tim Farrelly: (the link above would be able to edit
16/05/2025, 00:30 - Tim Farrelly: like the notion.so one up above from a few days ago
16/05/2025, 00:32 - Tim Farrelly: does that general plan look good to you? I think probably just the one thing we might want to think about is if we want to spend one more day anywhere. We'll pretty much just have one full day in London + a morning if we're up early, but I guess we can always quite easily get back to London for a weekend trip at another stage! Or also could stay in Paris for an extra night!
16/05/2025, 00:33 - Tim Farrelly: this maps out all the realistic flight options - if you're feeling up to it - give it a look!
16/05/2025, 00:33 - Tim Farrelly: if not dw, hopefully you'll be better tmrw, and can book then. I think the one question is just yeah, if we want to spend an extra day anywhere
16/05/2025, 00:34 - Tim Farrelly: (I include flight options shifted back by a day too)
16/05/2025, 01:50 - Vita: hello! feeling a little better, going for some food with friends now:,)
16/05/2025, 01:50 - Vita: will have a little look asap
16/05/2025, 01:50 - Vita: okay so i got a little confused and thought we were doing paris instead of stockholm
16/05/2025, 01:52 - Vita: but you’re thinking both?
16/05/2025, 01:52 - Vita: tbh tim as much as i’d love to spend another day im gonna be so unbelievably horrifically broke
16/05/2025, 01:53 - Vita: im not feeling 1000% tho still so may not be the best time for me to be making decisions re this
16/05/2025, 01:54 - Vita: but yes generally this looks good!
16/05/2025, 01:54 - Vita: just cant quite swing an extra day anywhere hahaha
16/05/2025, 01:54 - Vita: thank you hehe - I had a fuckton of dioralyte hahah

18/05/2025, 21:20 - Tim Farrelly: have booked this airbnb for us in London: 

https://www.airbnb.ie/rooms/1363097962121771720?check_in=2025-06-04&check_out=2025-06-05&guests=1&adults=2&s=67&unique_share_id=6cb27e2d-f87a-4513-acb4-4b6ad744ed92

19/05/2025, 01:22 - Tim Farrelly: flights booked for the 12th in paris!
19/05/2025, 01:22 - Tim Farrelly: just need to book an airbnb now for it - there's actually quite a few good and cheap options
19/05/2025, 01:26 - Tim Farrelly: https://www.britishmuseum.org/exhibitions/hiroshige-artist-open-road

this will be so sick
19/05/2025, 01:28 - Tim Farrelly: https://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/exhibitions/2025/edvard-munch-portraits/

munch portraits - this could also be cool
19/05/2025, 01:35 - Tim Farrelly: FYI, just wondering about London in the evening would be lovely, definitely going to a bar, but seeing a ballet on the cheap is an option too fyi (can get top row tickets for £8 or £14 lol)

https://www.rbo.org.uk/tickets-and-events/onegin-details
19/05/2025, 01:49 - Tim Farrelly: https://www.operan.se/en/productions/the-opera-in-haga

ah sick! we got lucky with the timing - June 6th Friday is Swedish national day so there'll be ballet and concerts on in a public park in Stockholm
19/05/2025, 01:57 - Vita: ballet would be so gorgeous!
19/05/2025, 01:57 - Vita: omg!!!!
19/05/2025, 01:57 - Vita: this will be so so so nice
19/05/2025, 01:58 - Vita: just out atm but will reply properly in a bit
19/05/2025, 01:58 - Tim Farrelly: £8 like haha!
19/05/2025, 01:58 - Vita: <Media omitted>
19/05/2025, 01:58 - Tim Farrelly: nice
19/05/2025, 01:58 - Vita: where i am rn with everyone hehe
19/05/2025, 01:58 - Tim Farrelly: im just up researching
19/05/2025, 01:58 - Vita: going for dinner in a few!
19/05/2025, 01:58 - Tim Farrelly: there's so much good stuff on
19/05/2025, 01:58 - Vita: seriously
19/05/2025, 01:58 - Vita: im so excited!
19/05/2025, 01:58 - Vita: we’ll have an amazing time
19/05/2025, 01:58 - Tim Farrelly: ive signed us up for the paris ballet too - they all sell out instantly in the palais garnier - but im on an alert list and will keep an eye on the 2nd hand ones
19/05/2025, 01:59 - Tim Farrelly: its the place with the Chagall rooftop
19/05/2025, 01:59 - Tim Farrelly: ill probably just get us an airbnb that is cancel-able/ refundable tonight - there's quite a few options for paris
19/05/2025, 02:00 - Tim Farrelly: main thing im prioritising is being cheap + close to transport links/ easy to get to the city + ideally our own place too thats not too small since we'll be there 3 nights
19/05/2025, 02:06 - Tim Farrelly: yeah will def book the paris airbnb tonight - the one I was looking at earlier is not gone:')
19/05/2025, 03:35 - Tim Farrelly: Ok so for paris, I went ahead and booked this place:
https://www.airbnb.ie/rooms/48547101?check_in=2025-06-09&check_out=2025-06-12&guests=1&adults=2&s=67&unique_share_id=3de542bb-a7dd-42c4-920a-97f8193ea41c

its €220 for 3 nights, our own flat, and about a 10 min walk for us to an RER station, which would bring us near the louvre in 15 mins
19/05/2025, 03:35 - Tim Farrelly: have a look and see what you think - it has free cancellation until June 8th, so we can cancel it if we find somewhere else nice!
19/05/2025, 03:36 - Tim Farrelly: This was the other main place that I was considering (although had a fairly thorough look around at others!)

its €321, but literally in the very centre of the city!

19/05/2025, 03:40 - Tim Farrelly: (let me know your thoughts if you'd fancy going for the more central place! I'm more than happy with either)
19/05/2025, 03:46 - Tim Farrelly: Ok so after getting the address, I'm seeing that it's further from places than the reviews and such said. Google maps says it's a 20 minute walk to the train station from it
19/05/2025, 03:49 - Tim Farrelly: https://gagosian.com/exhibitions/2024/james-turrell-at-one/

Oh fyi the James Turrell exhibit is still on if you'd like to see it

19/05/2025, 06:09 - Vita: ah thats a pity - though my thoughts are maybe not the worst if we’re doing a full day in the city and only popping back to sleep? but i guess the walk could be a bit gruelling at the end of a long day hmmm
19/05/2025, 06:09 - Vita: its a pity bc that place sounded ideal
19/05/2025, 06:10 - Vita: tbh im happy to go for more afforable options since i imagine we wont be spending huge amounts of time in the airbnb?

27/05/2025, 08:23 - Tim Farrelly: Meeting the cfo of OpenAI in Dogpatch lol

27/05/2025, 12:01 - Tim Farrelly: hello
27/05/2025, 12:02 - Tim Farrelly: the talk was really good!
27/05/2025, 12:02 - Tim Farrelly: it was sarah friar and patricia Scanlon - sarah being the cfo of OpenAI
27/05/2025, 12:02 - Tim Farrelly: she seems to be one of those kinds of people - chief execs, seems super lovely, I think she's probably like in her late 40s but wouldn't be surprised if she has a 6 pack hahah
27/05/2025, 12:03 - Tim Farrelly: and very good natural speaker
27/05/2025, 12:03 - Tim Farrelly: I don't think meeting up during the day will actually suit too well today - I really have a lot of patch work to catch up on unfortunately - sounds like you're busy enough anyways! But I really am very very very looking forward to seeing you later!
27/05/2025, 12:04 - Tim Farrelly: Fancy a quick call though at some stage!? <This message was edited>

27/05/2025, 14:39 - Tim Farrelly: ok amazing - sailing was pushed back by 30 mins so itll most likely be about 9.30 when I get to you if im realistic - will come straight there from the yacht club!

04/06/2025, 11:02 - Vita: dublin bus core X
04/06/2025, 11:02 - Vita: gonna get a coffee now anyway its very cold on the platform hahaha
04/06/2025, 11:02 - Tim Farrelly: Are you coming into St Pancras or King’s Cross
04/06/2025, 11:04 - Vita: St Pancras!
04/06/2025, 11:05 - Tim Farrelly: Grand!
04/06/2025, 11:05 - Vita: cant wait to see you :,)
04/06/2025, 11:06 - Vita: amazing!
04/06/2025, 11:06 - Vita: are they cheaper than our luggage place? lol
04/06/2025, 11:06 - Tim Farrelly: Haven’t seen yet but I’d assume so
04/06/2025, 11:06 - Tim Farrelly: Keep me updated anyways
04/06/2025, 11:07 - Vita: wait omg
04/06/2025, 11:08 - Vita: im a bimbo
04/06/2025, 11:08 - Vita: the trains here!
04/06/2025, 11:08 - Vita: its expected in st pancras at 11;38
04/06/2025, 11:08 - Vita: woohooo
04/06/2025, 11:08 - Vita: i misinterpreted the sign
04/06/2025, 11:09 - Tim Farrelly: Ah ok great
04/06/2025, 11:09 - Tim Farrelly: !
04/06/2025, 11:09 - Vita: never been so happy to be wrong lol
04/06/2025, 11:09 - Tim Farrelly: Seems luggage isn’t any cheaper here, £5 per bag for the day
04/06/2025, 11:10 - Vita: awh flop, honestly makes it worse that theyre charging in our airbnb tho like its common courtesy
04/06/2025, 11:12 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah I’m really not impressed with them at all - might just ask them now about early check in for £10 as it’s the same price
04/06/2025, 11:12 - Tim Farrelly: It’s particularly why I chose self check in tbh so we could drop off our bags. We should have been able to check in from 10, just to leave our bags, when the last check out
04/06/2025, 11:22 - Vita: okay update on my train adventure
04/06/2025, 11:22 - Vita: we still have not started moving which is concerning lol
04/06/2025, 11:22 - Vita: just been sitting on here the past 15 mins
04/06/2025, 11:22 - Vita: just noticed the time
04/06/2025, 11:22 - Vita: hmmm
04/06/2025, 11:25 - Vita: will let you know when we start moving here :(
04/06/2025, 11:26 - Vita: asked a nice man im sitting next to, it is apparently now due in st pancras at 12:16
04/06/2025, 11:26 - Vita: so sorry about this again!
04/06/2025, 11:26 - Vita: hopefully you’ll be able to drop your bags and have a bit of food before i arrive!
04/06/2025, 11:26 - Vita: have you had brekkie?
04/06/2025, 11:26 - Tim Farrelly: ah ok thanks for updating - ah sure
04/06/2025, 11:26 - Tim Farrelly: where are you coming from?
04/06/2025, 11:27 - Vita: coming from ashford international!
04/06/2025, 11:27 - Vita: thought this was gonna be super smooth hahaha
04/06/2025, 11:27 - Tim Farrelly: asked about how feasible it'd be to do early check in - might just go ahead with a local bag drop here
04/06/2025, 11:27 - Vita: famous last words
04/06/2025, 11:28 - Vita: sure thing!
04/06/2025, 11:28 - Vita: lmk what you end up doing anyway
04/06/2025, 11:29 - Tim Farrelly: im just working here atm - trying my best with the internet connection haha
04/06/2025, 11:29 - Tim Farrelly: right besdie the piano where someone is playing lovely movie compositions

04/06/2025, 11:29 - Vita: hahaha very fair
04/06/2025, 11:29 - Vita: awww thats so lovely!
04/06/2025, 11:29 - Vita: i love when people use the pianos at train stations!
04/06/2025, 11:30 - Vita: the guy on the loudspeaker is saying theyre waiting on more carriages for the train? which is why its late
04/06/2025, 11:31 - Tim Farrelly: theres updates on google maps btw re: your train!
04/06/2025, 11:32 - Vita: yes i just saw this!
04/06/2025, 11:32 - Vita: though its only giving me by how long its delayed by / what time we get in
04/06/2025, 11:32 - Vita: has it given you anything extra?
04/06/2025, 11:34 - Tim Farrelly: thats what I meant
04/06/2025, 11:34 - Vita: ah fair play
04/06/2025, 11:35 - Vita: thanks!
04/06/2025, 11:40 - Vita: omg
04/06/2025, 11:40 - Vita: there are some roadmen boys sitting across from me on the train
04/06/2025, 11:40 - Vita: talking about how they “manage” onlyfans girls, and the misogyny out of them is actually nauseating omg
04/06/2025, 11:41 - Vita: “they’re just girls innit they wouldnt understand that”
04/06/2025, 11:42 - Vita: but like genuinely they sound lobotomised
04/06/2025, 11:42 - Tim Farrelly: a caricature of sorts lol
04/06/2025, 11:42 - Vita: FULLY
04/06/2025, 11:42 - Vita: theyre such roadmen as well hahaha
04/06/2025, 11:43 - Tim Farrelly: stone islands?
04/06/2025, 11:43 - Tim Farrelly: is the train moving along yet? saw it disappeared from google maps
04/06/2025, 11:43 - Vita: moving finally!
04/06/2025, 11:43 - Tim Farrelly: unless the route has changed
04/06/2025, 11:43 - Tim Farrelly: ah nice one
04/06/2025, 11:44 - Tim Farrelly: is it still due for 12.20?
04/06/2025, 11:45 - Tim Farrelly: in which case - we might as well just have lunch and walk around with our luggage for a short bit I'd think
04/06/2025, 11:55 - Vita: nope! we’re powering along here hehe
04/06/2025, 11:55 - Vita: sure thing!
04/06/2025, 11:55 - Vita: indeed

04/06/2025, 12:00 - Vita: theres an itsu a 10 min walk from st pancras ;)
04/06/2025, 12:00 - Vita: and another one 20 mins away beside regents park if we wanna go for a stroll:)
04/06/2025, 12:01 - Tim Farrelly: ah nice!
04/06/2025, 12:02 - Tim Farrelly: lemme just see which way that is
04/06/2025, 12:02 - Vita: looking at food options as well - theres turkish, a small bento restaurant, greek, chinese (out of the very top rated in the area ofc hehe)
04/06/2025, 12:02 - Vita: its the opposite way to our airbnb unfortunately i fear
04/06/2025, 12:03 - Vita: as is the other one but obvs thats only 10 mins away
04/06/2025, 12:03 - Vita: which is a bit more chill

04/06/2025, 12:03 - Tim Farrelly: ah yeah just saw - whatever you think looks good!

04/06/2025, 12:03 - Vita: perhaps the closer one so?!
04/06/2025, 12:03 - Tim Farrelly: lets do that so!
04/06/2025, 12:03 - Vita: amazing!

09/06/2025, 22:20 - Tim Farrelly: Hi Tim, I hope this message finds you well!
Here is some information to welcome you next week.
Do you know your ideal check-in and checkout times?

📍 The address is 80 rue du Faubourg Poissonnière, 75010 Paris.
🚇 The nearest metro station is "Poissonnière" on line 7.
🚪 The porch code is 4370B, then take the first door on the right (building D, just after the mailboxes), go up the stairs to the 5th and last floor, head left and it will be the first door on the left (with a deer on the door).

🗝 I will welcome you in person, for the departure we will see each other but there is a key box on the door of the apartment, and the code is 4456.

🍚🧂🍾 As mentioned in the listing, this is an apartment that I occupy and so there are food basics in the cupboards, I invite you to make yourself at home and use everything, including the bottles in the living room.

🧼The solid block in the shower is a shampoo and you have soap and bottled shampoo if you prefer. The shower washcloth is also clean and can be used if the tap seems a little hard to turn.

☕ The coffee is next to the coffee maker. Please note, the plug is connected to the switch, which must therefore be activated to turn on the coffee machine.
🫖 Tea bags are also next to it, but you have better loose tea in the corner cupboard of the kitchen.

🛌 The bed is on the ceiling, you just have to undo the two feet that are stored in a horizontal position along the bed on the ceiling to put them in a vertical position and then pull the bed down until it rests well on its 4 feet. I use stools as footrests to make it easier to climb into bed.

🧺 The sheets will be clean and installed and you will also have two sets of clean towels.
You have an iron and a small ironing board as well as a hair dryer to the left of the washing machine.

🗑️ the bins are under the sink, a craft paper bag to the right of the kitchen sink serves as a glass bin.

🧹At the end of your stay, don't worry about the sheets, the bins, or the cleaning. I'll take care of it.
If you can just leave the unused towels folded, if there are any, that would be great.

🌡️ I'll let you manage the heating as you see fit (between the 2 windows), you can turn it on with the "power" button and adjust it with the "+" and the "-" but you must then press and hold "ok" to validate the choice

🌐 Regarding the internet,
the box is: Bbox-541981BC
the code to copy and paste (watch out for conversation translators) is: PorteurDe33Histoires

🗄The wooden cabinet at the entrance on the right and one side of the bathroom mirror have been freed up so you can put your things there (both open). In the latter there are new earplugs if you need them, but the street is quiet.

💡The light under the bed and the bedside lamp are switched on at the switch halfway up the bed at the shelf.
The light in the cabinet comes on on its right side at the height of the large drawer.

🌌For the night, you can close the exterior shutters by pulling on the small white ring that is on the shutter itself along the exterior wall and/or use the curtains if you prefer.

📞 If you need anything, please don't hesitate to call me (06 78 30 11 21).

🥖 As for bakeries, you have Michalak, which is very well-made, and Union, a more rustic bakery, which are excellent.

Wishing you a beautiful day and looking forward to welcoming you,
Kind regards,

22/06/2025, 17:16 - Tim Farrelly: I’m making slow prohibits the website
22/06/2025, 17:16 - Vita: <Media omitted>

22/06/2025, 17:18 - Tim Farrelly: Ooo it has been a while! I’d love to, unless you’d fancy waiting until I’m in student accommodation and have my own bed sheets/ an en suite bathroom :)
22/06/2025, 17:18 - Tim Farrelly: Hahahaha oh Maria
22/06/2025, 17:19 - Tim Farrelly: Would lowkey love to see her notes app just out of curiousity lol
22/06/2025, 17:23 - Tim Farrelly: Oh btw, a potential date could be for us to take a kayak out next time the weathers nice
22/06/2025, 17:24 - Vita: oooh this’d be fab!
22/06/2025, 17:24 - Tim Farrelly: And like go relatively far away from the coast/ out towards bull island’s quiet parts hehe;)
22/06/2025, 17:24 - Vita: 👀
22/06/2025, 17:24 - Vita: hehehe
22/06/2025, 17:24 - Tim Farrelly: Heheh
22/06/2025, 17:24 - Vita: do you guys have kayaks or would we need to rent one?
22/06/2025, 17:25 - Vita: also if we ever go paddleboarding together i think that would be hilarious if we had sex on the paddleboard on some (quiet and not visible to polish families) water
22/06/2025, 17:26 - Vita: hahahaha no very much likewise
22/06/2025, 17:26 - Vita: i feel like half of it is vents and the other half raunchy stuff
22/06/2025, 17:27 - Vita: she does keep a list of people she’s got with / their nationalities the same way you do ahahaha
22/06/2025, 17:27 - Vita: would really love this ;)

22/06/2025, 17:28 - Tim Farrelly: I respect that hahaha!!
22/06/2025, 17:28 - Tim Farrelly: Bullish on our sex lol
22/06/2025, 17:28 - Vita: ooh! i can prep tomorrow anyway and we can decide then based on if my parents are out or something - this is a good point though, depending on what the vibes are it could be potentially a shout to wait
22/06/2025, 17:29 - Vita: hehehe very very much likewise ;)
22/06/2025, 17:30 - Vita: a more long term project could be to have sex somewhere beautiful in nature in every county lol - we already have dublin and wicklow ticked off ;)
22/06/2025, 17:30 - Vita: i imagine passively over time we will achieve this hehe
22/06/2025, 17:33 - Tim Farrelly: Sounds good!
22/06/2025, 17:34 - Tim Farrelly: Hahahaha yeah I love that

25/06/2025, 23:03 - Tim Farrelly: Besides Dostoevsky - what are your fav books btw?
25/06/2025, 23:04 - Tim Farrelly: Want to send Tom and his fiancée a couple books for their wedding
25/06/2025, 23:24 - Vita: awww hehe likewise
25/06/2025, 23:30 - Vita: a few faves in no particular order:
- a picture of dorian grey
- ⁠poor (by katriona osullivan - not so sure how suitable thisd be but sooooo good would recommend it to everyone)
- ⁠an artist of the floating world by kazuo ishiguro
- ⁠breakfast at tiffanys by truman capote 
- ⁠symphony for the city of the dead (about shostakovich during the siege of leningrad, so so good tho also idk how suitable this’d be for a wedding haha but also just incredible) <This message was edited>
25/06/2025, 23:31 - Vita: tbh the unbearable lightness of being is probably up there as one of my favourites ever too at this point, but also unsure how suitable that’d be as a wedding present lol
25/06/2025, 23:32 - Vita: let me know what you end up choosing for this though! thats a really really cute idea :)
25/06/2025, 23:57 - Tim Farrelly: Haha perhaps not that one!
25/06/2025, 23:57 - Tim Farrelly: But those are amazing - thank you:)
25/06/2025, 23:57 - Tim Farrelly: I think insomniac city for sure - I think his fiancée would like that - I think we have similar tastes
25/06/2025, 23:57 - Tim Farrelly: And not sure for tom, potentially fragile lives tbh!
25/06/2025, 23:58 - Tim Farrelly: I need to get my hands on the Shostakovich one - he might enjoy that!
26/06/2025, 00:19 - Vita: of course! always glad to help out some fellow bibliophiles ;)

07/07/2025, 23:33 - Tim Farrelly: https://ifi.ie/film/ran-40th-anniversary/
07/07/2025, 23:33 - Tim Farrelly: Ran, Akira Kurosaw’s adaptation of King Lear, playing in 4k restoration the evening of July 9th!! Self-recommending!!!
07/07/2025, 23:33 - Tim Farrelly: “Ran, Akira Kurosawa’s majestic late masterpiece, reimagines Shakespeare’s King Lear as a historical epic set in sixteenth-century Japan. At the age of seventy, after years of consolidating his empire, the Great Lord Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai) decides to abdicate and divide his domain amongst his three sons. Taro (Akira Terao), the eldest, will rule while Jiro (Jinpachi Nezu), his second son, and Saburo (Daisuke Ryu) will take command of the Second and Third Castles but are expected to obey and support their elder brother. Saburo defies the pledge of obedience and is banished. Visually resplendent, Ran is a profound examination of the folly of war, and of a family’s collapse under the weight of betrayal, greed, and an insatiable thirst for power.”

02/08/2025, 12:53 - Tim Farrelly: Bit of a rant, but the large exhibition on in here ATM is just so bad hahaha
02/08/2025, 12:53 - Tim Farrelly: Like not even in a funny way like the sex thing we saw the last time

02/08/2025, 13:11 - Tim Farrelly: I thought this piece was quite cool
02/08/2025, 13:11 - Tim Farrelly: A bunch of broken mirrors on the ground and a few projectors projecting light on them 

Just their reflections actually being like separated and far apart is kind of cool from the cracks
02/08/2025, 13:12 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>

02/08/2025, 15:30 - Vita: but i know what you mean
02/08/2025, 15:31 - Vita: its an ethos which is a problem in modern art i feel
02/08/2025, 15:31 - Vita: fake deep stuff thats just odd rather than esoteric which earned people good grades in art school
02/08/2025, 15:31 - Tim Farrelly: No it was actually flower and bean!
02/08/2025, 15:31 - Tim Farrelly: Two pups is a good bit further up
02/08/2025, 15:32 - Tim Farrelly: Or like another 5 mins maybe haha

02/08/2025, 15:32 - Tim Farrelly: Like really
02/08/2025, 15:33 - Vita: this says so much about queer identity and rural ireland❤️
02/08/2025, 15:33 - Tim Farrelly: I mean some piles of dirt I can get behind, Giuseppe penone has done some fantastic stuff with piles of dirt
02/08/2025, 15:33 - Tim Farrelly: But that like...
02/08/2025, 15:33 - Tim Farrelly: Hahahah this wasn't the queer stuff, I didn't even wanna take photos of that

05/08/2025, 18:19 - Tim Farrelly: Someone has a broken/ sprained ankle
05/08/2025, 18:19 - Tim Farrelly: Just out sailing so listen in a bit!
05/08/2025, 18:20 - Tim Farrelly: But is there anything around Dublin where he can go or would you recommend?
05/08/2025, 18:30 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
05/08/2025, 18:30 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
05/08/2025, 18:30 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
05/08/2025, 18:31 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah was sore a few days ago but isn’t that bad now, just swelling and bruising getting worse still, I can send over a picture now !
05/08/2025, 20:14 - Vita: feck sorry only seeing this now!
05/08/2025, 20:14 - Vita: is he able to weight bear?
05/08/2025, 20:14 - Vita: and / or have limited range of motion?
05/08/2025, 20:15 - Vita: and does he have health insurance?
05/08/2025, 20:15 - Vita: if hes unable to weight bear and limited range of motion he needs to be seen asap
05/08/2025, 20:15 - Vita: there’s likely a fracture there from the looks of it but he’d need imaging to confirm. if he has private health insurance that’d br clutch to get the imaging done asap
05/08/2025, 20:16 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah he's able to walk!
05/08/2025, 20:16 - Vita: otherwise he’ll need to go to the ed which will take ages because as gnarly as it looks it wont be top on their list haha
05/08/2025, 20:16 - Tim Farrelly: If he had a medical card would that be any use? I know he's on susi so likely would have that too
05/08/2025, 20:17 - Tim Farrelly: This was a quote from him!
05/08/2025, 20:17 - Tim Farrelly: Can walk, just bruising is still happening
05/08/2025, 20:17 - Vita: okay so he should reach out to whoever provides his healthcare. in the meantime limit weight bearing activity (may worsen existing fracture), elevate the foot with pillows at night, take paracetamol as needed and apply ice
05/08/2025, 20:18 - Vita: if he can get a hold of a pair of crutches thatd be ideal
05/08/2025, 20:19 - Vita: sorry reply properly in a sec!
05/08/2025, 20:24 - Tim Farrelly: Me too!
05/08/2025, 20:24 - Tim Farrelly: Thanks so much for this
05/08/2025, 20:47 - Vita: no problem at all:)
05/08/2025, 20:47 - Vita: sorry was meal prepping my breakfasts for the week and the blender broke💔
05/08/2025, 20:47 - Vita: anyway lol
05/08/2025, 20:48 - Vita: can i ask like what happened to his ankle to begin with? did he twist it or apply force in a funny way?
05/08/2025, 20:48 - Vita: he’ll need to go to the ED on one of his days off unforch i think
05/08/2025, 20:48 - Vita: to get it looked at
05/08/2025, 20:49 - Vita: otherwise he can find a gp that does walk ins
05/08/2025, 20:49 - Vita: usually would cost about €60 for the gp
05/08/2025, 20:50 - Vita: aww no probs btw, im soooo excited for oslo eek!!!
05/08/2025, 20:50 - Vita: im gonna be researching restaurants in a few :))

05/08/2025, 21:11 - Tim Farrelly: Ah leaving that for another day and popping home sounds like the right call!
05/08/2025, 21:12 - Tim Farrelly: I'm absolutely wrecked myself so wonder if we woke each other up much last night or something

12/08/2025, 12:43 - Tim Farrelly: Hahahah ofc
12/08/2025, 12:44 - Tim Farrelly: I assume it'll be a bit tender/ sore walking around/ a bit of a distraction
12/08/2025, 12:44 - Tim Farrelly: Like there's a big difference between cryo on my thumb with tough skin vs my delicate (yet massive) dick
12/08/2025, 12:44 - Tim Farrelly: Early next week! It seemed they didn't have anything open earlier this week

12/08/2025, 12:46 - Tim Farrelly: Do you think I should push to get it at 9.30 on Friday morning? Would it grow much/ be more resistant if I wait over the weekend?
12/08/2025, 13:01 - Vita: it might get bigger - the smaller it is the easier to remove but entirely up to yourself

27/08/2025, 22:09 - Vita: might be borrowing your tshirt for this evening btw hehe
27/08/2025, 22:12 - Tim Farrelly: Hi, 

The apartment will be ready jno later than 15 tomorrow. When you arrive you will find a Black calling system, the left side of the gate. Please call Nina Birkeland and I will open both doors for you. 

Go in, take the red elevator to the 4th floor. My apartment is the 4th door to the left. Its a sign on the door that says Nina. There you will find a Key box. The pin is 2187. Here you will find the key for the apartment and a yellow beeper for the gate/door down stairs. The pin to the key box needs to be pressed before opening and also before closing the box (so twice). 

Next time you are entering the building use the yellow beeper on the key and place it towards the smal black box (left side of the gate/door) and beep. Should be quite easy.

WiFi: plsfix_5G password: michaelscott.

The garbage is through the door by the bikes. Please take out the trash when you leave. Please also bring with you or throw away any food that is left. 

check out is at 12. Please leave the apartment as you found it (for the cleaning staff). Thank you 😊 Later check out is possible if you need it. In case just give me a heads up. 

When leaving remember to put the key back in the key box. Please double check that the box is locked.

I set out some small things to make your stay pleasant, such as oil, salt and pepper, coffee, and tea. There is a bottle of cold tap water in the fridge, along with a bottle of wine for you 😊. I also put out some earplugs in the bedroom, and there is shampoo and conditioner in the bathroom.

Hope you will have a great stay and take good care of the place for me.

If you have any questions don’t hesitate to ask. 


Kind regards Nina

01/09/2025, 20:29 - Tim Farrelly: Like it said online it was delayed by 1 min, even reducing it from 2 mins while I was running

09/09/2025, 12:18 - Tim Farrelly: So my hearing seems to be fine physically - I wonder if there's just something with how my brain works that I don't do well with background noise and parsing the words people are saying
09/09/2025, 12:18 - Tim Farrelly: idk
09/09/2025, 12:18 - Tim Farrelly: if anything comes to mind please let me know - otherwise ill have a chat with ChatGPT later

11/09/2025, 15:54 - Tim Farrelly: I feel like the medium might be a bit too tight for me still - and I might not wear it as much
11/09/2025, 15:54 - Tim Farrelly: but not sure if the large is just a tad too big - in which case I might find another quarter zip elsewhere or something
11/09/2025, 17:10 - Vita: hmm if you feel this way then defo dont get it. i think the large is too big tho :(

15/09/2025, 00:07 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
15/09/2025, 00:07 - Tim Farrelly: venice an option but an early flight on the Friday - how guaranteed are you to be able to pick when you have annual leave for psych do you know?

16/09/2025, 15:28 - Tim Farrelly: 2. Still have that tender knee, it's like below the right knee, where it just becomes tender after a few km and I get the sense I should stop
16/09/2025, 15:28 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
16/09/2025, 15:28 - Tim Farrelly: Right there
16/09/2025, 15:28 - Tim Farrelly: Ye wouldn't have any advice would you?

16/09/2025, 17:31 - Vita: yes defo low impact cardio for the time being
16/09/2025, 17:32 - Vita: could be damage to the cartilaginous structure from that half you did awhile back, other than rest and other forms of low impact cardio theres not much else to be done other than maybe trying a knee brace if youre desperate to keep running
16/09/2025, 17:32 - Vita: aww hehehe youll get it back in no time!
16/09/2025, 17:32 - Vita: ahahahaha ;)

16/09/2025, 19:28 - Tim Farrelly: But that'd be super handy
16/09/2025, 19:29 - Tim Farrelly: We were never able to get membership unfortunately
16/09/2025, 19:29 - Tim Farrelly: Hmm does anything else come to mind if it's been like 6 months almost since the half? Seems like it should be healed by now haha
16/09/2025, 19:29 - Tim Farrelly: Yes definitely!
16/09/2025, 19:30 - Tim Farrelly: I have a nice chill evening in front of me now

17/09/2025, 04:16 - Tim Farrelly: I'm gonna make a web app tmrw which makes it much easier to browse through all the art exhibition going on everywhere

17/09/2025, 11:58 - Tim Farrelly: I assume that's likely still an early infection?

23/09/2025, 11:57 - Tim Farrelly: she's very intelligent
23/09/2025, 11:58 - Tim Farrelly: and very cool! its a good conversation, louise perry is also lovely, ive been meaning to go back and read that book of hers fully
23/09/2025, 11:58 - Tim Farrelly: chaksha - its an Indian just down the road from Dogpatch
23/09/2025, 11:58 - Tim Farrelly: didn't quite fill it out fully - will do so later today!
23/09/2025, 11:59 - Tim Farrelly: but basically the Ryanair flights all run at the same time and there's not too many to Venice so its quite predictable
23/09/2025, 11:59 - Tim Farrelly: time wise like
23/09/2025, 11:59 - Tim Farrelly: there's only so many options you can take this time of the year
23/09/2025, 12:00 - Tim Farrelly: oh brilliant hahaha! ill watch it in a bit uflly
23/09/2025, 12:00 - Tim Farrelly: https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0?si=qhlX2_kGIqASBe0F

similarly this is the best thing ive seen in a while
23/09/2025, 18:19 - Vita: bahahahaha fuck youuu
23/09/2025, 18:19 - Vita: good morning btw lol
23/09/2025, 18:20 - Vita: bahaha i really need to watch this, im so intruiged
23/09/2025, 18:20 - Tim Farrelly: good morning hahahaha
23/09/2025, 18:20 - Tim Farrelly: gotcha
23/09/2025, 18:20 - Tim Farrelly: I recommend! its very interesting
23/09/2025, 18:21 - Tim Farrelly: how soon are you heading to the hospital?
23/09/2025, 18:21 - Tim Farrelly: i still haven't got around to the flights btw but will soon!
23/09/2025, 18:21 - Vita: this is also very interesting; i’ve seen therapists and stuff say that she appears to disassociate during scenes but also i dont think any online therapist who spends their time speculating on a pornstar (who theyve never met)’s emotionally wellbeing is probably particularly legit
23/09/2025, 18:21 - Tim Farrelly: hahah i don't think
23/09/2025, 18:21 - Tim Farrelly: so
23/09/2025, 18:21 - Tim Farrelly: the main thing is her crying at the end of the 100 man rally
23/09/2025, 18:22 - Tim Farrelly: i don't think they were all very nice to her
23/09/2025, 18:22 - Tim Farrelly: but ah sure
23/09/2025, 18:22 - Tim Farrelly: lol
23/09/2025, 18:22 - Vita: yeah it really comes down to boundaries and stuff and having these things well planned
23/09/2025, 18:23 - Tim Farrelly: ill do this right now actually - basically Ryanair flies at the same time every week from novemeber onwards so there's limited enough options - ill write those out
23/09/2025, 18:23 - Vita: for 8:45! gonna leave here at 8 to stroll down
23/09/2025, 18:23 - Vita: but rn time for a massive cup of coffee and a shower lol
23/09/2025, 18:23 - Vita: oh damn! please do x
23/09/2025, 18:23 - Vita: aer lingus also goes there but not sure what those prices are like
23/09/2025, 18:24 - Vita: my mum was saying to be sure to fly into marco polo
23/09/2025, 18:24 - Vita: im soooo excited i love venice
23/09/2025, 18:36 - Tim Farrelly: https://ethereal-society-312.notion.site/Xmas-travels-with-Vita-25-2760833ba0fa80d6ac60d69c4e948e51?source=copy_link
23/09/2025, 18:36 - Tim Farrelly: ok check that out
23/09/2025, 18:36 - Tim Farrelly: what's your email for notion - i can add you to this
23/09/2025, 18:36 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
23/09/2025, 18:36 - Tim Farrelly: ive added that
23/09/2025, 18:37 - Tim Farrelly: basically this sheet just looks at the times that Ryanair (or others) fly out to different cities weekly
23/09/2025, 18:37 - Tim Farrelly: the main constraint being that you can only take so many days off so its good to in a sense have an idea of where we could travel and get full days in
23/09/2025, 18:38 - Tim Farrelly: have a look - let me know what you think
23/09/2025, 18:38 - Tim Farrelly: feel free to add any other cities or your thoughts on venice
23/09/2025, 18:40 - Vita: just from having a quick look there in fairness we could go thursday to sunday?
23/09/2025, 18:40 - Vita: thank you so much for making this btw!
23/09/2025, 18:41 - Vita: yeah i guess, tho i reallyyyy wanna go to venice hahaha
23/09/2025, 18:42 - Vita: or thursday to monday <This message was edited>
23/09/2025, 18:42 - Vita: lmk what you think?
23/09/2025, 18:46 - Tim Farrelly: I think Thursday to Monday would be great if you're up for coming back at 00:30 and being a bit tired in work the next day
23/09/2025, 18:47 - Tim Farrelly: i won't have that issue so its up to you
23/09/2025, 18:47 - Tim Farrelly: I just think if we go venice it'd be so good to do a day trip to Murano and maybe do a glass blowing workshop! that'd be a full day
23/09/2025, 18:51 - Vita: ah yeah yolo we might as well
23/09/2025, 18:51 - Vita: glass blowing would be very very cool
23/09/2025, 18:53 - Tim Farrelly: fuck yeah!
23/09/2025, 18:53 - Tim Farrelly: flights are cheap fwiw
23/09/2025, 18:53 - Tim Farrelly: 25 euro each way for venice
23/09/2025, 18:54 - Tim Farrelly: and can get a really nice apartment in the centre without much searching for like 125 a night (emphasizing that this is from a very quick look)
23/09/2025, 18:54 - Tim Farrelly: there's loads of airbnbs there
23/09/2025, 18:58 - Tim Farrelly: Thursday the flight is at 4pm, so you'd need to take a half day off (or the full day if you can't take a half day)

Or there's a very early flight in on the Friday at 7:45am in the morning fyi
23/09/2025, 18:58 - Tim Farrelly: ill ask lucy how many days she think she'd visit venice for
23/09/2025, 19:02 - Tim Farrelly: ah and one other note - the architecture biennale ends nov 23rd so if we go with venice, that weekend would be good to visit!
23/09/2025, 19:09 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
23/09/2025, 19:09 - Tim Farrelly: From Lucy
23/09/2025, 19:41 - Vita: this is fucking baller lmao
23/09/2025, 19:41 - Vita: omg wonderful
23/09/2025, 19:42 - Vita: yeah lets do thursday to monday
23/09/2025, 19:42 - Vita: hehehe
23/09/2025, 19:42 - Vita: omg im exciteddd
23/09/2025, 19:47 - Tim Farrelly: Ok sweet!
23/09/2025, 19:48 - Tim Farrelly: and if we want, we can do a day trip to somewhere like verona (from Romeo and Juliet lol?) or somewhere else nearby too!
23/09/2025, 19:48 - Tim Farrelly: 
23/09/2025, 19:56 - Vita: tbh i think between murano and venice we’d probs have a pretty packed schedule! id be inclined to leave that for a seperate trip
23/09/2025, 19:56 - Vita: also call back in a sec just getting my stuff together to go:)
23/09/2025, 19:57 - Vita: and i may not have a huge amount of time on the phone just a headsup! i need my walking music brainless time to decompress ahead of the night :,)
23/09/2025, 19:58 - Tim Farrelly: Ofc!
23/09/2025, 19:59 - Tim Farrelly: Quick call perhaps would be good
23/09/2025, 19:59 - Tim Farrelly: Just let me know when
23/09/2025, 19:59 - Tim Farrelly: I don't think I'm gonna go gym this evening as I'm just really tired but think I'll head out for a walk soon ish again:)
23/09/2025, 19:59 - Vita: next five just gotta leave!
23/09/2025, 20:00 - Tim Farrelly: Perfect
23/09/2025, 20:05 - Vita: 
23/09/2025, 20:05 - Tim Farrelly: 2 mins
23/09/2025, 20:06 - Vita: are you on the loo👀
23/09/2025, 20:10 - Tim Farrelly: 
23/09/2025, 21:12 - Tim Farrelly: Booking flights now
23/09/2025, 21:12 - Tim Farrelly: !
23/09/2025, 21:13 - Tim Farrelly: I'll just get 1x 10kg bag for the two of us
23/09/2025, 21:13 - Tim Farrelly: We ended up being fine in Stockholm with our backpacks and a tote bag so I'd say that's grand!
23/09/2025, 21:16 - Tim Farrelly: It's actually only an extra 5 euro per flight (insane honestly for Ryanair!) to get a 20kg checked in bag
23/09/2025, 21:17 - Tim Farrelly: I'll just check the size of glass things that we could be blowing but ignoring price I think I'd probs still favour a 10kg carryon, can be sure stuff is handled with care and much faster for getting in and out of airports
23/09/2025, 21:27 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
23/09/2025, 21:27 - Tim Farrelly: Booked!
23/09/2025, 21:33 - Tim Farrelly: Chatgpt recommends staying in Cannaregio or Dorsoduro
23/09/2025, 21:33 - Tim Farrelly: Quieter areas than San Polo, which is the exact center. Would be interested to hear which areas your mom suggests
23/09/2025, 21:37 - Tim Farrelly: https://italysegreta.com/an-11-stop-guide-to-carlo-scarpas-venice/

24/09/2025, 00:59 - Tim Farrelly: I just went with the 10kg
24/09/2025, 00:59 - Tim Farrelly: Perhaps the 20kg could have been a better shout but ah sure! We'll manage !
24/09/2025, 01:00 - Tim Farrelly: (I just prefer the carry ons so don't have to wait for luggage or risk the airline losing it lol or if there's anything fragile)
24/09/2025, 01:00 - Tim Farrelly: And oh my god all the places are soooo nice vita

24/09/2025, 21:40 - Tim Farrelly: Haven't yet - shall soon :)
24/09/2025, 21:40 - Tim Farrelly: Will let ya know what it says tho
24/09/2025, 22:54 - Tim Farrelly: ok so ChatGPT suggested potentially...
24/09/2025, 22:54 - Tim Farrelly: hidden hearing loss
24/09/2025, 22:55 - Tim Farrelly: or auditory processing disorder (a brain thing)
24/09/2025, 22:55 - Tim Farrelly: neither of which would show up on that basic hearing test that I did - and suggested that I get a referral for the audiology lab at james or somewhere like that
24/09/2025, 22:55 - Tim Farrelly: which I think is what I'll try do!
24/09/2025, 22:55 - Tim Farrelly: https://chatgpt.com/share/68d468e6-11fc-8008-b7cf-9a3869fc637a
24/09/2025, 22:56 - Tim Farrelly: you might be interested in reading the thread to see ChatGPTs thoughts
24/09/2025, 22:56 - Tim Farrelly: "
Hidden Hearing Loss (HHL): A type of hearing difficulty caused by damage to the connections (synapses) between inner ear hair cells and the auditory nerve. Standard hearing tests in quiet often look normal, but people struggle to understand speech in noisy environments.

Auditory Processing Disorder (APD): A brain-based difficulty in how the auditory system processes sound. The ears work normally, but the brain has trouble separating, organizing, or interpreting sounds — especially speech in background noise.
"
24/09/2025, 22:56 - Tim Farrelly: it could potentially be the latter given I tend to have a bit of a harder time parsing lyrics from songs
25/09/2025, 02:00 - Tim Farrelly: Goodnight xx hope all is going ok:)
25/09/2025, 02:00 - Tim Farrelly: Look forward to seeing you soon !
25/09/2025, 03:15 - Tim Farrelly: Agh taking me a while to get to sleep, I really need to read my book before bed hahah
25/09/2025, 03:15 - Tim Farrelly: If it works out time wise, it'd be lovely to see you tmrw evening:)

25/09/2025, 15:41 - Tim Farrelly: I think I'm oging to prepare for the interview tmrw now and then wrap up with patch stuff; then I'll do a quick bit of FOV work, and then go gym, and then just continue with FOV work before I come over to see you
25/09/2025, 15:41 - Tim Farrelly: let me know how things are looking for the pub quiz later!
25/09/2025, 16:47 - Vita: looks like people are going for 8:30ish but i presume me and the girls will be a bit after since we’re meeting for dinner at 7:00!
25/09/2025, 16:47 - Vita: oh noo is she sick? :(
25/09/2025, 16:47 - Vita: im just in town with mum now! having coffee in bewleys

25/09/2025, 17:00 - Tim Farrelly: does it sound good for me to potentially meet you there a bit after 9 - im just trying to get a good bit of work done + get out to the gym
25/09/2025, 17:01 - Tim Farrelly: all done for patch and the internview prep for tmrw anwyays: )
25/09/2025, 18:20 - Vita: whenever suits! tbh 9:30 is probs more realistic for my mates anyway bahaha

28/09/2025, 00:31 - Vita: goodnight! xx
28/09/2025, 12:00 - Tim Farrelly: Good morning
28/09/2025, 12:00 - Tim Farrelly: I had a great sleep
28/09/2025, 12:00 - Tim Farrelly: About 11.5 hours og it
28/09/2025, 12:00 - Tim Farrelly: Of*
28/09/2025, 12:00 - Tim Farrelly: I have a terrible feeling that Jim might have been here tho and just Trish went to the hospital lol
28/09/2025, 12:01 - Tim Farrelly: And a similarly terrible feeling the Airbnb-ers maybe were just having an early night lol (but am less certain of this)
28/09/2025, 12:02 - Tim Farrelly: It had gone through my mind just as we started to double check that Jim also went hospital, but thought since the dogs were all downstairs theyre most likely both gone (almost certain)
28/09/2025, 12:04 - Tim Farrelly: But when I popped in when Trish came back said "I went" rather than "we went", but she was tired so hopefully that'sa slip. 

In the phone earlier she had said "We would go" so fingers crossed
28/09/2025, 12:06 - Vita: goodmorning!
28/09/2025, 12:06 - Vita: sorry for not texting earlier was running around like mad hehe
28/09/2025, 12:07 - Vita: sleeps still a bit fucked from nights so overslept and fam was rushing me

28/09/2025, 12:38 - Tim Farrelly: Technical ones
28/09/2025, 14:12 - Tim Farrelly: Ok so they both went into the hospital last night!!!
28/09/2025, 14:59 - Tim Farrelly: https://www.thecut.com/2024/01/couture-review-margiela.html

28/09/2025, 15:36 - Tim Farrelly: What is that?
28/09/2025, 15:59 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
28/09/2025, 15:59 - Tim Farrelly: Unfortunately tore my jacket sailing yesterday:')
28/09/2025, 15:59 - Tim Farrelly: Need to not wear this jacket sailing again
28/09/2025, 15:59 - Tim Farrelly: But ah sure, know now
28/09/2025, 15:59 - Tim Farrelly: Looks like it's years old instead of brand new :')
28/09/2025, 16:14 - Vita: duck confit!
28/09/2025, 16:15 - Vita: we’re at lyons estate the food is sooo delicious hehe
28/09/2025, 16:15 - Vita: omg no :(
28/09/2025, 16:15 - Vita: thats so so annoying!
28/09/2025, 16:21 - Tim Farrelly: Very nice!
28/09/2025, 16:22 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah quite a pity. Annoying especially that I was aware that maybe this could happen and I was generally being quite careful - I should have just tried to get a different jacket I guess
28/09/2025, 16:22 - Tim Farrelly: But lesson learned I guess :)
28/09/2025, 17:38 - Vita: awww real pity :( but yeah you know for the future! and the jacket still looks lovely xx
28/09/2025, 17:38 - Vita: we on the way home now! will send a vm when im back hehe
28/09/2025, 18:41 - Vita: <Media omitted>
28/09/2025, 19:11 - Tim Farrelly: That sounds like a nice day!
28/09/2025, 19:11 - Tim Farrelly: What would be great is if you could confirm with your mom which areas in Venice are nice
28/09/2025, 19:11 - Tim Farrelly: Then we can go about getting an airbnb
28/09/2025, 19:12 - Tim Farrelly: It's generally trust chatgpt with the sort of thing but confirm with your mom there
28/09/2025, 19:23 - Vita: i’ll ask her!
28/09/2025, 19:23 - Vita: yes i certainly shall
28/09/2025, 19:23 - Vita: yay!

28/09/2025, 19:33 - Vita: no they were fucking stunning
28/09/2025, 19:33 - Vita: especially the old style ones
28/09/2025, 19:34 - Vita: we’ll defo be able to get a lovely one
28/09/2025, 19:34 - Vita: what did you get up to today in the end? get to the gym or anything? :)
28/09/2025, 19:42 - Vita: Some thoughts...
Anywhere in walking distance from the water bus from Marco Polo Airport. The bus company is called Alilaguna, along the blue line.
1. San Marco
2. San Stae or
3. San Polo
Hope this helps, let me know what you are thinking of if you want more thoughts x
28/09/2025, 19:42 - Vita: ^ this is what she said!
28/09/2025, 19:42 - Vita: she also said anywhere along the vaparetto 1 line would be amazing either
28/09/2025, 19:58 - Tim Farrelly: nothing at all really!
28/09/2025, 19:58 - Tim Farrelly: got out for a run
28/09/2025, 19:58 - Tim Farrelly: but otherwise quite tired
28/09/2025, 19:58 - Tim Farrelly: im just sitting down with my laptop now tho
28/09/2025, 19:58 - Tim Farrelly: is that another water bus line?
28/09/2025, 19:58 - Tim Farrelly: thats super helpful tho thanks!
28/09/2025, 19:59 - Vita: yes the vaparettos are the dublin bus of the water in venice as far as i know!
28/09/2025, 19:59 - Tim Farrelly: ok cool!
28/09/2025, 19:59 - Vita: apparently a 3 day ticket for them is spenny but highly necessary and worth it
28/09/2025, 20:00 - Vita: like works out to about €25/day of transport
28/09/2025, 20:00 - Vita: but apparently you get good use out of it
28/09/2025, 21:43 - Tim Farrelly: ok noted!
28/09/2025, 21:43 - Tim Farrelly: did any of the airbnbs I had saved stand out to you?
28/09/2025, 21:44 - Tim Farrelly: might be no harm to just book one that's fully refundable - I think most of them are !
28/09/2025, 22:16 - Vita: yes id agree with this!
28/09/2025, 22:18 - Vita: <Media omitted>
28/09/2025, 22:18 - Vita: this one is jaw droppingly gorgeous but might be a bit far from the areas we’d be visiting
28/09/2025, 22:18 - Vita: but sooo beautiful
28/09/2025, 22:18 - Vita: <Media omitted>

29/09/2025, 22:07 - Tim Farrelly: 
29/09/2025, 22:55 - Tim Farrelly: do you think you'd have any time tmrw to research what should be done with respect to the biennale - like is it the kind of thing we can see in a day, is it all in one place, etc.?
29/09/2025, 22:55 - Tim Farrelly: https://www.labiennale.org/en/architecture/2025/information#tickets
29/09/2025, 22:57 - Tim Farrelly: also basically all of reddit seems to suggest staying in Cannaregio so I might err towards there with the airbnb
29/09/2025, 22:57 - Vita: yes i can ask the experts ;)
29/09/2025, 22:57 - Tim Farrelly: its a bit quieter than the super central areas - will have smaller authentic cafes and such
29/09/2025, 22:57 - Vita: they said theres an ai themed thing on that you’d be obsessed with this year bahaha
29/09/2025, 22:58 - Tim Farrelly: (essential for pastries)

29/09/2025, 23:27 - Tim Farrelly: let me know what you think
29/09/2025, 23:27 - Tim Farrelly: I think its the best of the different options - and is actually in the central place, but apparently on a bit of a quieter square
29/09/2025, 23:28 - Tim Farrelly: In hindsight, I need to get into the habit of moving fast if I see a good airbnb haha, there were a couple in the last batch that were particularly nice, but I think this is pretty good too
29/09/2025, 23:28 - Tim Farrelly: good location, has a little balcony although its just overlooking rooftops
29/09/2025, 23:28 - Tim Farrelly: and has a nice wooden charm to it

30/09/2025, 12:01 - Tim Farrelly: I think one of the main things im realising that id care about in airbnbs is just:

30/09/2025, 12:01 - Tim Farrelly: genuinely
30/09/2025, 12:01 - Tim Farrelly: and a little balcony with a view is always great

03/10/2025, 20:58 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>

04/10/2025, 05:13 - Vita: <Media omitted>
04/10/2025, 11:12 - Tim Farrelly: Jeez hello!

04/10/2025, 11:22 - Vita: 
04/10/2025, 12:50 - Tim Farrelly: 
04/10/2025, 12:50 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
04/10/2025, 12:50 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
04/10/2025, 12:50 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
04/10/2025, 12:50 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
04/10/2025, 12:50 - Tim Farrelly: Hello
04/10/2025, 12:50 - Tim Farrelly: Excuse the photos
04/10/2025, 12:51 - Tim Farrelly: But I believe that our local GP is striking again with *gross negligence*
04/10/2025, 12:53 - Tim Farrelly: Jim went over to the gp for this, and the gp just froze it and didn't mention anything else, didn't offer possible diagnosis and just offered to freeze it and come back in a couple weeks or to cut it off for 100 euros <This message was edited>
04/10/2025, 12:54 - Tim Farrelly: More context, this thing has grown to this size within a couple weeks
04/10/2025, 12:54 - Tim Farrelly: Quick chat with chatgpt + googling, does it look like a keratin horn and the fast growth suggests it's a cancerous or precancerous base ?
04/10/2025, 12:58 - Tim Farrelly: I'd frankly be inclined to report him to the medical council or whoever I can report him now after this - not acting cautious and referring to a derm is unforgivable here
04/10/2025, 13:16 - Vita: yep they need to biopsy that
04/10/2025, 13:16 - Vita: in fairness what jim needs is a new gp tho
04/10/2025, 13:17 - Vita: i wouldnt bother with a medical council complaint until you have a safe gp for your parents
04/10/2025, 13:17 - Vita: just being completely rational here
04/10/2025, 13:23 - Tim Farrelly: What does that mean?
04/10/2025, 13:24 - Tim Farrelly: I've said this to them many times before, and just there again, but they don't act on it
04/10/2025, 13:24 - Vita: no just complaints will take years
04/10/2025, 13:24 - Vita: what will be faster and more effective as a safety net is a new doctor lmao
04/10/2025, 13:24 - Tim Farrelly: Important for there to be a paper trail? I'm mainly thinking of other people here with this
04/10/2025, 13:25 - Vita: well yes but like
04/10/2025, 13:25 - Vita: the priority here is your parents health right?
04/10/2025, 13:25 - Tim Farrelly: Both
04/10/2025, 13:25 - Tim Farrelly: It's a low effort thing making the complaint
04/10/2025, 13:25 - Tim Farrelly: I can't get them a new gp, thats something they should do
04/10/2025, 13:26 - Tim Farrelly: I might just get them to do it in front of me
04/10/2025, 13:26 - Vita: welp just my opinion anyway
04/10/2025, 13:26 - Vita: but yes
04/10/2025, 13:26 - Vita: 100% lol
04/10/2025, 13:27 - Tim Farrelly: Like if he's repeatedly doing shit things with my fam he's doing it with others, and in cases like this, on the tail end, he's definitely costing many negative QALYs by being a shit doctor
04/10/2025, 13:27 - Tim Farrelly: And not being cautious where it's obviously required
04/10/2025, 13:35 - Vita: if making the complaint now will make you feel better then do it, but what im saying is it’ll take like a few years for the complaint to come through and for him to be brought in. so the immediate priority here is for jim to get that thing biopsied
04/10/2025, 13:35 - Vita: im kinda amazed they still havent changed gps after such bad experiences
04/10/2025, 13:36 - Vita: i know its a hassle but like bruh he sounds like dr nick from the simpsons 💀
04/10/2025, 13:36 - Vita: anyway going gym now! then to tesco and then gonna get cooking!
04/10/2025, 13:36 - Vita: have decided against doing french onion soup jussstt yet
04/10/2025, 13:36 - Vita: will make it tmw methinks otherwise i’ll do a meat platter starter
04/10/2025, 13:41 - Tim Farrelly: Oh yeah no going to get him in with a dermatologist who I went to for my acne on Monday
04/10/2025, 13:41 - Tim Farrelly: Or like an appointment booked then
04/10/2025, 13:41 - Vita: ok brilliant
04/10/2025, 13:41 - Tim Farrelly: Who is good im confident in saying, and certainly cautious
04/10/2025, 13:41 - Vita: yeah bc wtf that keratin horn came in so quick
04/10/2025, 13:42 - Vita: but the good thing is if its removed quickly then it should be totally fine even if there is precancerous or cancerous stuff at the base
04/10/2025, 13:42 - Tim Farrelly: My mom won't go to Allman actually when she can avoid it (can get an appointment with someone else) but Jim, idk, he seems to like Allman, I don't know
04/10/2025, 13:42 - Vita: like my mum didnt quite have a keratin horn but she had a pre-SCC on her arm and got it whipped off
04/10/2025, 13:42 - Tim Farrelly: I've just arrived too!
04/10/2025, 13:43 - Vita: have you decided what your plan is for the day? hehe
04/10/2025, 13:43 - Tim Farrelly: That's good!
04/10/2025, 13:43 - Vita: btw emma might be popping in for a cup of tea later!
04/10/2025, 13:43 - Tim Farrelly: In the likely/ hopeful case!
04/10/2025, 13:43 - Tim Farrelly: Gym! Then reading/ coding
04/10/2025, 13:44 - Tim Farrelly: The howth guys are gonna watch a match in a pub at 5.30
04/10/2025, 13:44 - Vita: sounds absolutely lovely:)
04/10/2025, 13:44 - Tim Farrelly: I'll meet up with them after that
04/10/2025, 13:44 - Vita: im gonna try and have a bath this evening methinks
04/10/2025, 13:44 - Vita: oh perf!
04/10/2025, 13:44 - Tim Farrelly: So will probs come to you before then if that sounds good
04/10/2025, 13:44 - Vita: so will you be here for dinner?
04/10/2025, 13:45 - Tim Farrelly: Ah yes I probably will be if that suits
04/10/2025, 13:45 - Vita: sure ill let my mum know
04/10/2025, 13:45 - Vita: and what time will you be here around?
04/10/2025, 13:47 - Vita: looking forward to seeing you!
04/10/2025, 13:52 - Tim Farrelly: 5.30 onwards let's say!
04/10/2025, 13:52 - Tim Farrelly: Does that suit?
04/10/2025, 13:52 - Tim Farrelly: Same as!
04/10/2025, 13:52 - Tim Farrelly: I can't believe you thought I was going to wait for the complaint to go through to make an action hahaha
04/10/2025, 13:53 - Vita: sure thing! ill probs be cooking away hehe
04/10/2025, 13:53 - Tim Farrelly: Thanks for clarifying nonetheless haha

06/10/2025, 23:42 - Tim Farrelly: And did a coding test for one of the AI fellowships - I got 975/1000 (one test didn't pass within the time limit) so im really hoping they're ok with that, it could easily be the kind of thing where they just want someone who gets 1000/1000
06/10/2025, 23:42 - Tim Farrelly: Fingers crossed we'll see
06/10/2025, 23:42 - Tim Farrelly: Anyways goodnight xx

07/10/2025, 22:32 - Tim Farrelly: Sounds like some good management/ mentor passing down would really be helpful for hospital issues
07/10/2025, 22:32 - Tim Farrelly: I'm just back from the gym myself and lying in bed for a quick bit
07/10/2025, 22:32 - Vita: had a great time at the gym! just finishing dinner and gonna head upstairs and get ready for bed :,)

I'll help them tech wise in near term, but I think they'll run out of money before then anyways, and that if they want to survive they need to go ham with sales, not tech
07/10/2025, 22:33 - Tim Farrelly: If I mention there's an fov meeting in person, please remind me lol
07/10/2025, 22:34 - Tim Farrelly: I met Kevin over at the gym and had a nice chat

07/10/2025, 22:48 - Vita: as much as i would absolutely love to see you we may have to wait til sat if thats okay :,) the long days are just killer and i feel like im barely home and already need to be getting to bed :(

15/10/2025, 19:40 - Tim Farrelly: I'll order it now
15/10/2025, 19:41 - Vita: in any case its good practise to retest, not in a judgemental way at all but given the new onset of weird symptoms you should defo rule it out with a fresh test, especially since its been over six months since you tested negative
15/10/2025, 19:41 - Tim Farrelly: Is just urine test ok for me as I don't like the blood test too much and I surely don't have HIV or syphilis

15/10/2025, 19:42 - Tim Farrelly: (I'm just not feeling well and don't like the thought of effort lol)

16/10/2025, 09:00 - Tim Farrelly: I won't make tonight tragically if that's not obvious
16/10/2025, 09:00 - Tim Farrelly: Had to move over to other side of bed as was sweating too much lol
16/10/2025, 09:03 - Tim Farrelly: Setting up now and I feel soooo much better anyways!

16/10/2025, 12:34 - Tim Farrelly: Hey so I'm back from the doctor's a little bit now and it seems to just be a bad flu along with pleurisy
16/10/2025, 12:34 - Tim Farrelly: They did a urine sample and there's nothing wrong with my kidney and apparently there isn't anything wrong with my liver either
16/10/2025, 12:34 - Tim Farrelly: No real explanation for the testicular pain beyond just having general aches and pains from the viral load
16/10/2025, 12:35 - Tim Farrelly: I had the testicular pain just once today so far so it's become an even more infrequent so that's good

18/10/2025, 02:54 - Tim Farrelly: Ok actually going to sleep now haha, but thought I'd say, I was looking through old photos of us together and that you'd sent me (normal pics of you in Belgium, etc. + nudes/ launderie fitting hehe), I might be slightly delirious rn, but have noticed for a while lately fyi, that tho I obviously found you extremely stupidly hot and attractive when we met and early on, looking back on the same pics, I think my brain finds you like another step change in terms of hotness + natural beauty (those are 2 different things!)... Just an interesting observation;)
18/10/2025, 13:18 - Vita: good morning :)

26/10/2025, 21:06 - Tim Farrelly: So I don't really feel like going to a club, so I assume it's best for me to drive out to yours for 2am? <This message was edited>

26/10/2025, 21:55 - Vita: that’d be lovely! tysm :)
26/10/2025, 21:55 - Vita: cant wait to see you!
26/10/2025, 22:09 - Tim Farrelly: Question: would it be feasible for me to show up at yours early/ soon and wait for you there? No sure if your parents are up late or not

Another question: what would you think of me just coming over to you early tmrw morning instead? I'd obviously love to see you tonight but I might be quite tired by the time I'd be driving out (seem to have the same post-flu tiredness still):
27/10/2025, 00:16 - Vita: sorry of course! you are absolutely welcome to come over tmw morning if it suits better xx
27/10/2025, 00:17 - Vita: especially since tbh it might be a late one!

27/10/2025, 00:21 - Tim Farrelly: Haha enjoy your night!
27/10/2025, 00:21 - Tim Farrelly: I haven't been waking up too early lately, but perhaps might expect me to come over for about 12 if that sounds reasonable to you? <This message was edited>
27/10/2025, 00:38 - Vita: that sounds perfect’
27/10/2025, 00:38 - Vita: *!!

31/10/2025, 15:25 - Tim Farrelly: I've made it clear that I'll get the current tech projects done that they need, which Omar thinks will take longer than I've thought, till the end of January. I'll hopefully get them done before then tho - I'm aiming for end of December
31/10/2025, 15:26 - Tim Farrelly: Will work out the exact details still as we didn't have too much time before we were kicking out, and I'll probably write up an email and some details, and a spec on what exact tech things I need to get done
31/10/2025, 15:26 - Tim Farrelly: But yeah, all clear. I'm motivated now I guess to just get all those tech things done asap and they can get on with it

18/11/2025, 00:10 - Tim Farrelly: there's not a chance I'd be able to set a pic of you as mine - you're just way too distracting to look at
18/11/2025, 00:10 - Tim Farrelly: (i.e. you're too hot)
18/11/2025, 00:11 - Tim Farrelly: and i'm trying to spend less time on my phone

19/11/2025, 15:26 - Vita: wouldnt mind copping an italian vintage leather or fur jacket
19/11/2025, 15:26 - Vita: and a nice pair of gloves +/- hat
19/11/2025, 15:29 - Tim Farrelly: Let's !

19/11/2025, 15:30 - Tim Farrelly: I'd love to too!
19/11/2025, 15:30 - Tim Farrelly: What's it called do you know

19/11/2025, 15:53 - Tim Farrelly: Bullshit
19/11/2025, 15:53 - Tim Farrelly: I'll try handle it
19/11/2025, 15:54 - Tim Farrelly: 1. Keeping everything on Airbnb, not Whatsapp
19/11/2025, 15:54 - Tim Farrelly: Airbnb can monitor things that way
19/11/2025, 15:54 - Tim Farrelly: 2. That rule is incredibly deep in their rules. No mention of it on the listing or in their reviews. I found it, then clocked out, then it took me a while to find it again
19/11/2025, 15:56 - Tim Farrelly: 3. Especially unfair since they sent a massive text initially with a bunch of stuff (including other fees), which means you don't dig deeper
19/11/2025, 17:01 - Vita: WHAT
19/11/2025, 17:01 - Vita: thats so silly of them
19/11/2025, 17:01 - Vita: omfg
19/11/2025, 17:06 - Vita: <Media omitted>
19/11/2025, 17:50 - Tim Farrelly: Listen in a bit gonna respond first
19/11/2025, 18:43 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
19/11/2025, 18:43 - Tim Farrelly: I have a 10kg bag that I won't fill fully!
19/11/2025, 18:43 - Tim Farrelly: Which you can put stuff into
19/11/2025, 18:43 - Tim Farrelly: Let's call this evening
19/11/2025, 18:43 - Tim Farrelly: I'm free whenever
19/11/2025, 18:44 - Tim Farrelly: If you'd like/ if it'd work, maybe you could take a dart out towards howth and we could pick you up from Sutton and go to the airport? Or could come a tad earlier and get some food here and put your stuff into the 10kg bag

Or would an air coach be easier?
19/11/2025, 18:56 - Vita: that could work yes!
19/11/2025, 18:56 - Vita: if i might just get the dart to sutton and pop some stuff in your bag?
19/11/2025, 18:56 - Vita: 
19/11/2025, 19:11 - Tim Farrelly: I would not have booked this property had I known about a €50 late check-in fee. That's exactly why Airbnb requires clear disclosure of fees before booking
19/11/2025, 19:11 - Tim Farrelly: this shall be my next response
19/11/2025, 19:11 - Tim Farrelly: anyways - chat later!
19/11/2025, 19:11 - Tim Farrelly: thats perf!
19/11/2025, 19:18 - Tim Farrelly: Success I think re Airbnb

20/11/2025, 14:26 - Tim Farrelly: Dear Tim,
Buongiorno da Venezia and thank you for choosing my apartement for your stay in the magical Venezia!

From Marco Polo airport you can catch the bus Atvo to Piazzale Roma car terminal (10 euro/20 min ride) and then walk following the directions for the restaurant Birraria La Corte in Campo San Polo Square where we will meet (15 min by foot). 

Alternatively you can catch the waterbus Alilaguna line orange boat to San Stae stop (18 euro/1 hour ride) and then walk to Campo San Polo (6 min by foot). 

Or I can arrange a private car + water taxi waiting for you upon arrival and taking you to the closest dock to the apartment (2/3 min by foot), which is the most memorable but expensive way into Venice (150 euro tot/ride). 

Please let me know your arrival details in advance to arrange the best welcome and if you need further informations&assistance. 

You can reach me also on my mobile: 0039 3471476151.
I will add you on whatsapp for easier communication :)

Please note also that as per the house rules the city taxes (4 euro per person per night) are due in cash upon arrival.
20/11/2025, 14:26 - Tim Farrelly: It's 20 mins vs 60 mins by water taxi
20/11/2025, 14:26 - Tim Farrelly: What do you still think?
20/11/2025, 14:27 - Tim Farrelly: That was from our Airbnb host
20/11/2025, 14:29 - Tim Farrelly: And 2/3 the price
20/11/2025, 14:32 - Vita: hmm maybe the bus might be better if our flight is delayed
20/11/2025, 14:32 - Vita: we can discuss when youre here!
20/11/2025, 14:39 - Tim Farrelly: Where are you?

26/11/2025, 23:34 - Tim Farrelly: This reminds me of jiro dreams of sushi in a roundabout way

Homeless person who'd show up every day in a new outfit, whatever the city gave him we can only assume, never repeating. Extremely independent and tasteful - fashion houses later very directly copying his fits. Quite a craft

28/11/2025, 11:48 - Tim Farrelly: ended up just getting a choco hazelnut croissant from a 2nd Tesco I was passing!
28/11/2025, 11:48 - Tim Farrelly: just to save time as I was up fairly late all things considered haha
28/11/2025, 11:49 - Tim Farrelly: your mom mentioned there might be a concert on in your local parish on Monday btw that could be cool - can you get the details off her later?
28/11/2025, 12:31 - Tim Farrelly: How much do you like the rituals body cream btw?
28/11/2025, 12:32 - Tim Farrelly: Lol

28/11/2025, 15:13 - Tim Farrelly: do you have much left lol?
28/11/2025, 15:14 - Tim Farrelly: that could be nice!
28/11/2025, 15:14 - Tim Farrelly: ah very nice
28/11/2025, 15:14 - Tim Farrelly: ive just been working
28/11/2025, 15:14 - Tim Farrelly: had a very nice sprout for lunch
28/11/2025, 15:14 - Tim Farrelly: gonna move onto fov work now though:)
28/11/2025, 15:49 - Vita: omg btw spoke to my consultant about the ai research - she’s v enthusiastic!
28/11/2025, 16:08 - Tim Farrelly: aw unreal!
28/11/2025, 16:08 - Tim Farrelly: what exactly is it you think you'd like to do? lay it out for me!
28/11/2025, 16:08 - Vita: reply properly in a few! just running around bc realised im on call now lolol
28/11/2025, 16:29 - Vita: so i’d like to get 10 psych professionals (preferably 5 consultants, 5 trainees, or a mix) to run 2 scenarios with chatgpt in which they are pretending to be a psychotic or manic patient. I will randomise who gets which scenario but they will be evenly split. The scenarios will be prompt blurbs which the clinician can run with the LLM play acting as patient and using clinical cues from their working experience to express subtle hints of psychotic or manic illness. I think a run time of 5 minutes per scenario or 5 - 10 interactions (havent ironed out this just yet) using voice to text chat should be sufficient. The goal would be to see how many interactions it takes for chatgpt to suggest speaking to a friend, doctor, or mental health professional. Secondary goal would be to see the level of sycophancy (hoping you could help me with metrics re: this), and to see if any ‘dangerous’ validating statements are made by the LLM (eg “you are not crazy” “this is not just in your head” “this is real”)
28/11/2025, 16:29 - Vita: thoughts? hehe
28/11/2025, 16:29 - Vita: v much open to feedback bc this is so in its infancy
28/11/2025, 16:34 - Tim Farrelly: aweseome! let me get back to you later
28/11/2025, 16:34 - Tim Farrelly: but the main thing that goes through my mind - is just that it'd be good to test this with another ai model too - maybe claude
28/11/2025, 16:35 - Tim Farrelly: I don't know if there's a way you can do it - but it'd be cool to have a human control - but I don't think there really is one here
28/11/2025, 16:35 - Tim Farrelly: without a good bit of work involved
28/11/2025, 16:37 - Vita: yeah id agree here
28/11/2025, 16:38 - Vita: itd be ideal but unfortunately unsure how a human control would work hmm
28/11/2025, 16:38 - Vita: yes this is defo a possibility
28/11/2025, 16:38 - Vita: and just copy paste the same text
28/11/2025, 16:39 - Vita: from the voice to text chat
28/11/2025, 16:39 - Vita: probs acc wouldnt be too much extra effort
28/11/2025, 16:39 - Vita: will keep that in mind for sure!
28/11/2025, 16:39 - Vita: my consultant was saying to try keep it as small as poss haha
28/11/2025, 16:39 - Vita: apparently the hospitals ethics committee deadline is 15th dec, and then they make a decision by 22nd jan
28/11/2025, 16:39 - Vita: would be well able to do it while im in michaels
28/11/2025, 16:40 - Vita: dr kane was saying that id need to do the ethics committee to get it published, which she thinks the irish journal of psychiatry would
28/11/2025, 16:40 - Tim Farrelly: was it dr kane btw who had read this paper: https://arxiv.org/html/2509.10970v2
28/11/2025, 16:41 - Tim Farrelly: "The Psychogenic Machine: Simulating AI Psychosis, Delusion Reinforcement and Harm Enablement in Large Language Models"
28/11/2025, 16:41 - Tim Farrelly: the one I found last night that was published 2 months ago
28/11/2025, 16:41 - Tim Farrelly: so a thing about this is that the human response does have to somewhat respond to what the llm responsds with in a multi turn setting
28/11/2025, 16:46 - Vita: no unfortunately that was someone else
28/11/2025, 16:46 - Vita: oh true actually
28/11/2025, 16:46 - Vita: yes i suppose could run the two models
28/11/2025, 16:46 - Vita: with the same scenario
28/11/2025, 18:47 - Vita: also was wondering would a possibly ok ‘control’ be another ai model doing the same thing and see if theres a discrepancy? or is that too muddy
28/11/2025, 18:47 - Vita: sorry on call so that might not be the most articulate haha
28/11/2025, 19:34 - Tim Farrelly: Text in a bit!
28/11/2025, 21:20 - Vita: no worries!
28/11/2025, 21:20 - Vita: im just getting the bus home post call :)
28/11/2025, 21:28 - Vita: it was so chill weirdly
28/11/2025, 21:28 - Vita: got like 5 bleeps the whole time?
28/11/2025, 21:33 - Vita: <Media omitted>
28/11/2025, 21:59 - Tim Farrelly: Good evening:)
28/11/2025, 21:59 - Tim Farrelly: Aww that's good that it was nice and chill!
28/11/2025, 21:59 - Tim Farrelly: I guess it's a high variance thing
28/11/2025, 21:59 - Tim Farrelly: Glad to hear
28/11/2025, 21:59 - Tim Farrelly: I'm just in bed now
28/11/2025, 22:00 - Tim Farrelly: Bout to do some reading :)
28/11/2025, 22:00 - Tim Farrelly: I did a very light leg and ab session earlier, but feeling kinda tired so didn't get too much more into it
28/11/2025, 22:00 - Tim Farrelly: Read the paper above! It's a good one
28/11/2025, 22:04 - Tim Farrelly: Who's the professor that had read it/ mentioned it - would you be interested in emailing them/ myself emailing them about any other things they'd have in mind that would be useful? (I was slightly disappointed that they had built the automated benchmark that we chatted about last night haha, I need to read it and related papers fully, I haven't got to the end yet, but it seems like important work and there might be a lack of open source datasets/ benchmarks in this area so id be keen to know if there's anything else they think would be useful)
28/11/2025, 22:04 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah what exactly do you mean here lol?
28/11/2025, 22:06 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>

28/11/2025, 22:24 - Tim Farrelly: Shocking difference between Claude (left green columns) and everything else basically lol
28/11/2025, 22:24 - Tim Farrelly: Dcs is encouraging delusions
28/11/2025, 22:24 - Vita: holy shit
28/11/2025, 22:24 - Tim Farrelly: Hes is enabling harm
28/11/2025, 22:25 - Tim Farrelly: 2 columns for each metric there (Ie "_hes" appended to the end
28/11/2025, 22:25 - Tim Farrelly: So yeah mirrors very much what we saw the other night
28/11/2025, 22:26 - Tim Farrelly: Like it literally scores almost all 0's
28/11/2025, 22:26 - Tim Farrelly: I'm really impressed
28/11/2025, 22:27 - Vita: <Media omitted>

28/11/2025, 22:30 - Vita: no i dont think any of the consultants mentioned that paper - i think we found that one ourselves last night
28/11/2025, 22:32 - Vita: prof odonoghue is the main prof for vincents psych, he may have read this but im not sure
28/11/2025, 22:32 - Tim Farrelly: Gotcha!
28/11/2025, 22:32 - Vita: but that specific one wasnt mentioned at teaching
28/11/2025, 22:32 - Tim Farrelly: Psychiatrists are the benchmark here I guess!
28/11/2025, 22:32 - Vita: yes 100%!

02/12/2025, 13:51 - Tim Farrelly: symptoms:
tight chested (assumed it was anxiety but also...)
blood oxygen of 83 
heart rate of 110 this morning but its down to 75 right now
slightly light headed (but could be from panicking slightly as ChatGPT is saying to be worried) <This message was edited>
02/12/2025, 13:51 - Tim Farrelly: hello - lucy has those symptoms - but she feels ok (but has very high pain tolerance ill add)
02/12/2025, 13:52 - Tim Farrelly: any advice? should she head to hospital/ doctors?
02/12/2025, 13:52 - Vita: yeah a desat to 83 is really bad
02/12/2025, 13:52 - Vita: she needs to go to the gp or hospital, wherever she will be seen quicker
02/12/2025, 13:53 - Vita: what was she doing when she got the reading?
02/12/2025, 13:53 - Tim Farrelly: lemme ask
02/12/2025, 13:54 - Tim Farrelly: "at home this morning it was 87 so warmed up my hands thinking that was it then it acc went down somehow then just in the office"
02/12/2025, 13:54 - Tim Farrelly: will advise her to head to GPs or hospital - thank you xx
02/12/2025, 13:54 - Vita: and has she got a cough? coughed up any blood or blood streaked sputum?
02/12/2025, 13:55 - Vita: what is she using to measure it?
02/12/2025, 13:55 - Tim Farrelly: no cough
02/12/2025, 13:55 - Tim Farrelly: some device - she checked it on a friend who had blood ocygen of 99 so I think its accurate
02/12/2025, 13:56 - Vita: yeah she needs to get medical attention, they need to rule out a clot or infection
02/12/2025, 13:56 - Tim Farrelly: were you checking for blood clot in lung?
02/12/2025, 13:56 - Tim Farrelly: ok cool - ill let her know - thank you very much - she'll be grateful (and me too )
02/12/2025, 13:57 - Vita: yeah desat in a young woman with history of pregnancy loss you’d need to make sure its not something like that
02/12/2025, 13:57 - Vita: aw poor lucy
02/12/2025, 13:57 - Vita: let me know how she gets on
02/12/2025, 13:57 - Vita: dont mention this later bit to her but she defo needs to make sure its not anything sinister
02/12/2025, 13:58 - Vita: no problem at all xx
02/12/2025, 13:59 - Vita: does she have any underlying lung probs like asthma?
02/12/2025, 14:00 - Tim Farrelly: 1 sec
02/12/2025, 14:00 - Tim Farrelly: her bf thinks she does - when she breathes when its cold out/ in winter, but its undiagnosed if so
02/12/2025, 14:01 - Tim Farrelly: when she breathes when its winter it feels like crushed a little bit
02/12/2025, 14:01 - Tim Farrelly: (cold air)
02/12/2025, 14:03 - Tim Farrelly: she had blood clots last year too fyi - im not sure if that was during the miscarriage or not
02/12/2025, 14:04 - Tim Farrelly: she's going to head to the doctors now anwyas !
02/12/2025, 14:06 - Tim Farrelly: ive asked her if she has any leg pain/ swelling fyi too
02/12/2025, 14:06 - Vita: great! yes if shes had a clot before she 1000% needs to get to the doctor

03/12/2025, 22:22 - Vita: i am however seething with myself rn
03/12/2025, 22:22 - Vita: like theyre perfectly edible btw, and taste great, just structural integrity took a hit in lieu of chewiness
03/12/2025, 22:23 - Vita: and after spending much time shelling the pistachios, then blanching them and skinning them BY HAND and then roasting them i think i can allow myself be proper bolloxed that the recipe was so fucking annoying
03/12/2025, 22:23 - Vita: like monday night was just the first step of an arduous process
03/12/2025, 22:24 - Vita: anyway im never working with pistachio again in that capacity and thats that
03/12/2025, 22:29 - Tim Farrelly: haha dont worry
03/12/2025, 22:29 - Tim Farrelly: you didn't call me the n word

03/12/2025, 22:30 - Vita: yeah for them to just fall apart, aside from being delicious, after all that, is really frustrating

03/12/2025, 22:31 - Tim Farrelly: i think im getting tired and slow

03/12/2025, 22:33 - Vita: if you get up at the same time every day and go to bed at the same time every day that might also help (saying this gently lol)

I regret not complaining to take it off the bill since he didn't give me what I ordered :') But ah sure
07/12/2025, 13:01 - Tim Farrelly: A bad Google review shall suffice, and next time (hopefully not for a long time) will ask for anything like that to be taken off the bill

08/12/2025, 19:23 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>
08/12/2025, 19:23 - Tim Farrelly: It's stunning but oh my god
08/12/2025, 19:23 - Tim Farrelly: I assume the architect was not able to touch the ceiling
08/12/2025, 19:23 - Tim Farrelly: It's quite tragic
08/12/2025, 19:23 - Tim Farrelly: It's so warm and cosy and tasteful on the floor
08/12/2025, 19:23 - Tim Farrelly: But the ceiling is so jarring
08/12/2025, 19:23 - Tim Farrelly: And cheap looking
08/12/2025, 19:23 - Tim Farrelly: Genuinely tragic
08/12/2025, 19:24 - Tim Farrelly: I'd wonder if your parents know the architects/ if there's any gossip about it, if I was designing this place and wasn't able to touch the ceiling to fix it idk
08/12/2025, 19:25 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>

09/12/2025, 12:48 - Tim Farrelly: i assume you don't have time for a break - but if you're able to get in a quick walk outside if you have time for food - it could be nice
