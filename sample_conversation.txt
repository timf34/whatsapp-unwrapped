04/11/2024, 18:46 - Tim Farrelly: Unexplained:') But ah sure!
04/11/2024, 18:46 - Vita: as much as I’d really love to see you tonight it miiight be slightly short notice:,(
04/11/2024, 18:46 - Vita: if tomorrow doesnt work then I could possibly rally but yeah I have a ton to do :(
04/11/2024, 18:46 - Tim Farrelly: Ah no worries, I just threw that at you !
04/11/2024, 18:47 - Tim Farrelly: Could be a study date too tho ofc if that's not clear btw!
04/11/2024, 18:47 - Vita: unfortunately not! but we did some very interesting variations on down dog as well as some sexxxxy twists (sexy as in i got the nicest back cracks ever from them hahaha)
04/11/2024, 18:47 - Tim Farrelly: (sorry let me take that back as it was the plan - I'll see you tmrw anyways! Looking forward to it:) )
04/11/2024, 18:48 - Vita: very much likewise:))
04/11/2024, 18:48 - Tim Farrelly: You need to crack my back sometime!
04/11/2024, 18:48 - Vita: yeah see I planned on donating blood tomorrow after placement so was gonna combine that with seeing you etc!
04/11/2024, 18:48 - Vita: so if its cool it’d suit me to stick to the original plan
04/11/2024, 18:49 - Vita: I will for sure;) and give your lats a quick massage should they need it hehe
04/11/2024, 18:49 - Vita: also! something else im very looking forward to talking to you about tomorrow is that I had a peruse of some of the kama sutra positions last night and some of them are mad hahaha
04/11/2024, 18:49 - Vita: but some also look quite tempting to try so want your opinions;)
04/11/2024, 18:50 - Tim Farrelly: Sounds good! What time suits you?
04/11/2024, 18:51 - Tim Farrelly: Is just after 9 ok? I think I'll go to water polo after the run club, as I'll be going home on Wednesday evening
04/11/2024, 18:52 - Tim Farrelly: Hahahah I'm always down
04/11/2024, 18:52 - Vita: actually I’ll be donating in the cool building on d’olier street! pity you wont be around to check it out with me haha - but next time:)
04/11/2024, 18:52 - Tim Farrelly: Where did you find them? Cosmopolitan or other sources?
04/11/2024, 18:52 - Tim Farrelly: What time!?
04/11/2024, 18:52 - Vita: I cannot reveal my sources at this current time👀
04/11/2024, 18:53 - Vita: it’ll be around 5:40 - which now that you say we’d be meeting at 9 i probs wont combine that with meeting you hahaha so perhaps a silly reason to defer from tonight
04/11/2024, 18:54 - Vita: hmm many thoughts
04/11/2024, 18:54 - Vita: either way I’ll be free after 8 so 9 is perfect:)
04/11/2024, 18:54 - Vita: agh see now you’re tempting me to be spontaneous and come out to see you tonight hahaha
04/11/2024, 18:55 - Tim Farrelly: _smiling_
04/11/2024, 18:55 - Tim Farrelly: <Media omitted>

04/11/2024, 18:55 - Vita: hehehe too late;)
04/11/2024, 18:55 - Tim Farrelly: I could pop by before my run club! I'd love to see inside!
04/11/2024, 18:55 - Vita: no take backsies😤
04/11/2024, 18:56 - Tim Farrelly: But really, whatever suits you best:) I'll fit everything in one way or another!
04/11/2024, 18:56 - Vita: hehehe
04/11/2024, 18:56 - Tim Farrelly: I could delete but consider it a gift😌
04/11/2024, 18:57 - Vita: okay not to be so annoying can I get back to you in 30 mins? so I can organize my thoughts(thots) and affairs😉
04/11/2024, 18:57 - Tim Farrelly: Hahaha yeah sounds good!
04/11/2024, 18:57 - Vita: dw my whatsapp is on autosave anyway🥵
04/11/2024, 18:57 - Vita: no escaping 😌
04/11/2024, 18:58 - Vita: fair warning if i do see you this evening I will be significantly less yassified than usual (but i promise no juicy tracksuit bottoms)
04/11/2024, 18:59 - Tim Farrelly: To let you know my plan, I'm just going to be working this evening, probably gonna head to the library now in a min. So am free whenever (for a study date).

Tmrw I have the run club at 6.20 (I'll need to leave around 6.10 so I'm not running to it, but tbh, I kinda need more than 5k so might run there anyways). Followed by water polo at 8, so will be free just after 9:)
04/11/2024, 19:01 - Tim Farrelly: Vita, I love how great you dress, but I'm honestly as happy to see you in leggings and no makeup very honestly!! (perhaps not the juicy couture tho😅)
04/11/2024, 19:01 - Tim Farrelly: You're hot, hot from far away, and hot with no makeup✅✅✅
04/11/2024, 19:01 - Tim Farrelly: ;)
04/11/2024, 19:02 - Vita: hehehe now I’m the one smiling;)
04/11/2024, 19:02 - Tim Farrelly: Emphasis on the _hot_ part
04/11/2024, 19:02 - Vita: okay perfect! let me get back to you on this!
04/11/2024, 19:03 - Tim Farrelly: Sounds good!
04/11/2024, 19:03 - Vita: I promise I’ll convert you to the juicies one way or another ;)
04/11/2024, 19:03 - Vita: (you’re very very sweet - and very much ditto)
04/11/2024, 19:26 - Vita: okay so …..
04/11/2024, 19:26 - Vita: is it cool if I join you in the lib?;)
04/11/2024, 19:27 - Vita: tonight that is
04/11/2024, 19:27 - Vita: because I thought about it a bit and I might be tired after donating blood tmw in which case might make more sense for me to work from home with a cup of tea:)
04/11/2024, 19:27 - Vita: will just get my affairs in order and head in the trinity direction hehe
04/11/2024, 19:34 - Tim Farrelly: Sounds good!!
04/11/2024, 19:34 - Tim Farrelly: That'll suit me best tbh:)
04/11/2024, 19:34 - Tim Farrelly: And could use some human motivation to get up out of bed and to the library as I'm absolutely wrecked lol

22/12/2024, 02:43 - Vita: we went to cis maddens in the end! and attempted nolita but it was full - nobody had the heart to trek to leggs in this weather loll
22/12/2024, 02:53 - Tim Farrelly: ah love to see it!
22/12/2024, 02:53 - Tim Farrelly: I just spent 5 hours on the Patch document - I should have got it done much faster but ah well
22/12/2024, 02:54 - Tim Farrelly: Onto more work now - just working out time/ commitments for Patch/ FOV, and then actually do some FOV work
22/12/2024, 02:54 - Tim Farrelly: ciss is always good vibes! were you outside?
22/12/2024, 03:07 - Vita: we actually managed to get a table inside which was mega good luck considering it was packed!

22/12/2024, 03:09 - Vita: night night tim :) xxx
22/12/2024, 05:59 - Tim Farrelly: Didn't make it that far, just found out I have a final assignment for a class due tmrw at 6pm lol (thankfully someone posted submitting it on their story hahah)
22/12/2024, 06:00 - Tim Farrelly: I would have stayed up working anyways, but was on that, need to finish it tmrw when I get up (need to make a 20 min video on a paper, all my slides are done now anyways )
22/12/2024, 06:01 - Tim Farrelly: I need better time tracking tools I think, to see how I'm spending time on my laptop - haven't found anything great yet!
22/12/2024, 06:01 - Tim Farrelly: It is! Will get feedback, but have a solid plan for if I do actually implement the initiative
22/12/2024, 06:04 - Tim Farrelly: Will text you tmrw, but could what are your thoughts on sleeping over late tmrw night (I won't get too drunk! You could join towards the end?)? Waking up and doing the Smithfield market/ Hugh Lane in the afternoon/ movie in the evening time? I might want to stay up late working the night of the 23rd (but I'm  unlikely to work when I get back tmrw night lol). Will text tmrw but let me know what you think of that!
22/12/2024, 06:06 - Tim Farrelly: All things considered, I really am quite productive from 9pm to 6am lmao
22/12/2024, 06:06 - Tim Farrelly: Anyways, hope you got some water before bed and get a good rest! Night x
22/12/2024, 12:36 - Vita: morning:) I woke up a lil while ago but have been dozing in bed hehe
22/12/2024, 12:36 - Vita: thank god you found out about that assignment tho hahaha good lord - is it worth much or just something small?
22/12/2024, 12:37 - Vita: oooh could be a side project if nothing exists…?👀
22/12/2024, 12:38 - Vita: we love to see it!:) v glad to hear
22/12/2024, 12:42 - Vita: and yeah this could potentially work! sure let me know how you’re feeling about it today anyway:) I’m not sure if I’d be up to joining pints later on because I’m grieviously hungover today somehow hahaha but can defo seee how I’m feeling later\just meet you after!
22/12/2024, 12:43 - Vita: hope you’re getting a good rest in:)
22/12/2024, 12:44 - Vita: a man built for the night shift…. you chose the wrong career😩
22/12/2024, 13:59 - Tim Farrelly: Good morning;)
22/12/2024, 13:59 - Tim Farrelly: How's the head haha?
22/12/2024, 13:59 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah no for real! I didn't bother checking - I don't think there was good documentation about how much it's worth, but at least 30% I'd say
22/12/2024, 14:00 - Tim Farrelly: Keep in mind a pass in 5th year is 50%, so yeah, thank God I found out lmao
22/12/2024, 14:01 - Tim Farrelly: I think so! There's already an open source version, but it ain't so good imo. It's tricky to do well, but I think I should be able to improve on things considerably
22/12/2024, 14:07 - Tim Farrelly: I think this would probably still suit well if it works for you! I'll text in a bit once I'm up properly to confirm if that's ok:) And no worries at all hahaha, hope you got some water and such before bed
22/12/2024, 14:26 - Vita: it’s not *too* bad hahaha - mostly just dehydrated and super tired:,)
22/12/2024, 14:26 - Vita: I’ve so much pre-christmas stuff to do today tho and have started on approximately zero loll
22/12/2024, 14:27 - Vita: but ah sure
22/12/2024, 14:27 - Vita: also wanna try get to the gym after i have a bit of food now but that will heavilyyy depend on if i feel nauseous or not after eating haha
22/12/2024, 14:28 - Vita: lmaoo thank god! wouldve been a christmas calamity if not 💀
22/12/2024, 14:28 - Vita: ngl tim as someone who gets anxious about college that’d be my worst nightmare hahaha
22/12/2024, 14:28 - Vita: but you got it sorted in no time anyway which we love to see:,)
22/12/2024, 14:29 - Vita: the mishap was no match for your efficiency!
22/12/2024, 14:29 - Vita: genuinely if you made a version of this I would 1000% use it hahah
22/12/2024, 14:30 - Vita: yeah sounds good - hopefully should be rested and un-hungover by the time I see you :,)

22/12/2024, 15:04 - Tim Farrelly: Ah sure indeed hahah, I'm sure it was a v good night! Is that mostly cooking and stuff, or what are you up to?
22/12/2024, 15:04 - Tim Farrelly: Hopefully you manage!
22/12/2024, 15:05 - Tim Farrelly: Still not finished it hahaha, I'm having brekkie rn (had a very slow and relaxed morning - shouldn't have, but ah well lol), and still need to write a script (via ChatGPT) and record a 20 minute video, but I shall manage
22/12/2024, 15:06 - Tim Farrelly: And need to do that in the 35 mins or will be late for 12 pubs hahah
22/12/2024, 15:06 - Tim Farrelly: Yes please!!!
22/12/2024, 15:06 - Tim Farrelly: A lil extra cardamom for me hehe;)
22/12/2024, 15:07 - Tim Farrelly: Yeah so if it works for you, I think it'd suit best if you came over later tonight with me, sleep over, and we have a nice date/ day during the day tmrw if that sounds good to you:)
22/12/2024, 15:08 - Tim Farrelly: Would you fancy coming to the gym with me here tmrw hahah? Should be able to sneak you in with sadhbhs student card! I unfortunately didn't wake up with time today (probably could have got in a quick one if I'd got straight out of bed and to work, but ah well)
22/12/2024, 15:38 - Vita: I made it to the gym! hehe
22/12/2024, 15:38 - Vita: so will reply properly in a bit :)

22/12/2024, 19:41 - Vita: <Media omitted>
22/12/2024, 19:41 - Vita: the loose cloves look a bit rank hahaha but the fruit was chilled so wasnt easy to stud them with the cloves
