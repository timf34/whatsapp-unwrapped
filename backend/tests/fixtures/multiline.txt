04/11/2024, 18:59 - Tim Farrelly: To let you know my plan, I'm just going to be working this evening, probably gonna head to the library now in a min. So am free whenever (for a study date).

Tmrw I have the run club at 6.20 (I'll need to leave around 6.10 so I'm not running to it, but tbh, I kinda need more than 5k so might run there anyways). Followed by water polo at 8, so will be free just after 9:)
